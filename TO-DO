_x_ There's only one blue ink. [Nope. See 41 and 70.]
_x_ The order seems wrong. [Fixed]
_x_ Pencil clusters around the middle
_x_ P1 is not in Césaire's hand
_x_ Fix Nebula to align with new figure p

[tl;dr: I make a bet that I can do genetic analysis on just one typescript, in this case, the first witness for Aimé Césaire's "Et les chiens se taisaient"; I introduce the text around Césaire's paradox of freedom and situation, because one shouldn't just do scholarly work of the 10 year variety because of a bet; I dive into the genesis of the text by framing its composition between 1941 and 1943 based on archival and textual evidence; a thorough codicology of the salient material features of the text follows; I reverse-engineer the pagination schemes of the witness, and combine it with the evidence gathered in the codicology to divide the genesis into nine stages of composition, pretty visualization and all.]

In classical textual scholarship they are quilting points that bridge conjecture to emendation, in the digital avatar, they are sites of. 

and the exception in turn proves that the transformation rules of a textual scholar find their bases in the *κατʼ αἴσθησιν* of Posidonius (via Quintillius).

In most of these cases, the rules take on the role of an editor in search of patterns to normalize and render, but in one case the rule addresses a unique occurrence, an exception. On `P2.9` (8), at the top, the characters "Crép" are overtyped with the letter x to make way for a parentheses. The whole didascalia is eventually erase. Because I'm reducing additions and deletions and normalizing some features, a monstruous decision in some quarters, I wanted to remove the double deletion. Instead of quickly editing the text at the tail end of the algorithmic transformation, I created a rule to deal with just this one case. Staying true to form, rather than simply finding and replacing the sequence "Crép", I made the rule in such a way that imagines the exception from a bibliographic point of view:

~~~         
<xsl:template match="tei:del[@rend='overprint']">
  <xsl:choose>
    <xsl:when test="@seq='1'"><span class="delete"><xsl:value-of select="normalize-space(text())"/></span>&#160;</xsl:when>
    <xsl:otherwise/>
  </xsl:choose>
</xsl:template>
~~~

This exceptional rule is a strange being with only one job—useless to a service provider, but not to the scholar, deriving its nomic purpose[^b16] from the empirical exception, *κατʼ αἴσθησιν*, and as such fertilizing the ground for questions of algorithmic ethics, *Ausnahmezustand*, human-machine labor relations, the role of the humanities, etc... but I digress. The immediate point of the exercise is to reduce all decisions to algorithms, to show how those algorithms can latch on to (encoded) bibliographic cues and to produce the speculative stage.

[^b16]: I point here, not without a grin, to Peter Suber's game [Nomic](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial%20set), where the game includes rules for changing rules in medias res.
