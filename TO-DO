[tl;dr: I make a bet that I can do genetic analysis on just one typescript, in this case, the first witness for Aimé Césaire's "Et les chiens se taisaient"; I introduce the text around Césaire's paradox of freedom and situation, because one shouldn't just do scholarly work of the 10 year variety because of a bet; I dive into the genesis of the text by framing its composition between 1941 and 1943 based on archival and textual evidence; a thorough codicology of the salient material features of the text follows; I reverse-engineer the pagination schemes of the witness, and combine it with the evidence gathered in the codicology to divide the genesis into nine stages of composition, pretty visualization and all.]

In classical textual scholarship they are quilting points that bridge conjecture to emendation, in the digital avatar, they are sites of. 

and the exception in turn proves that the transformation rules of a textual scholar find their bases in the *κατʼ αἴσθησιν* of Posidonius (via Quintillius).

In most of these cases, the rules take on the role of an editor in search of patterns to normalize and render, but in one case the rule addresses a unique occurrence, an exception. On `P2.9` (8), at the top, the characters "Crép" are overtyped with the letter x to make way for a parentheses. The whole didascalia is eventually erase. Because I'm reducing additions and deletions and normalizing some features, a monstruous decision in some quarters, I wanted to remove the double deletion. Instead of quickly editing the text at the tail end of the algorithmic transformation, I created a rule to deal with just this one case. Staying true to form, rather than simply finding and replacing the sequence "Crép", I made the rule in such a way that imagines the exception from a bibliographic point of view:

~~~         
<xsl:template match="tei:del[@rend='overprint']">
  <xsl:choose>
    <xsl:when test="@seq='1'"><span class="delete"><xsl:value-of select="normalize-space(text())"/></span>&#160;</xsl:when>
    <xsl:otherwise/>
  </xsl:choose>
</xsl:template>
~~~

This exceptional rule is a strange being with only one job—useless to a service provider, but not to the scholar, deriving its nomic purpose[^b16] from the empirical exception, *κατʼ αἴσθησιν*, and as such fertilizing the ground for questions of algorithmic ethics, *Ausnahmezustand*, human-machine labor relations, the role of the humanities, etc... but I digress. The immediate point of the exercise is to reduce all decisions to algorithms, to show how those algorithms can latch on to (encoded) bibliographic cues and to produce the speculative stage.

[^b16]: I point here, not without a grin, to Peter Suber's game [Nomic](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/nomic.htm#initial%20set), where the game includes rules for changing rules in medias res.

and following-sibling::*[1][starts-with(., '(')]

if you go there and stand in the place where it was, it will happen again

In most of these cases, the rules take on the role of an editor in search of patterns to normalize and render, but in one case the rule addresses a unique occurrence, an exception. On `P2.9` (8), at the top, the characters "Crép" are overtyped with the letter x to make way for a parentheses. The whole didascalia is eventually erased. As a general rule, I've omitted all minor overtypes, but I wanted to keep this one because it calls attention to the vascillation in this stage direction: from none, to one, to none again on the previous page. Instead of quickly editing the text at the tail end of the algorithmic transformation, as a sane person would, I created a rule to make the edit. And staying true to form, rather than a simple find and replace for the sequence "Crép", I chose a rule that understands the exception from a bibliographic point of view:

~~~         
<xsl:template match="tei:del[@rend='overprint']">
  <xsl:choose>
    <xsl:when test="substring(text(),1,3) = substring(following-sibling::*[1]/text(),2,3) and text()[not(starts-with(., '('))] and following-sibling::*[1][starts-with(., '(')]">
...
~~~

The rule basically says: find all the cases that have been overtyped, then for each one check to see if the following segment begins with the same three letters, except with a parentheses; if so, include and style this segment as a deletion. In short, my own rationale for making the choice. This exceptional rule is a strange being with only one job—useless to a service provider, but not to the scholar, deriving its nomic purpose from the empirical exception[^b16], *κατʼ αἴσθησιν*, and as such fertilizing the ground for questions of algorithmic ethics, *Ausnahmezustanden*, human-machine labor relations, etc. The immediate point of the exercise, though, is to reduce all decisions to algorithms, to show how those algorithms can latch on to (encoded) bibliographic cues and to produce a purposeful speculative stage.

Monsieur Toussaint 

Cahier:

Ce qui est à moi aussi: une petite cellule dans le Jura,
une petite cellule, la neige la double de barreaux blancs
la neige est un geôlier blanc qui monte la garde devant une prison
Ce qui est à moi
c’est un homme seul emprisonné de blanc
c’est un homme seul qui défie les cris blancs de la mort blanche
(TOUSSAINT, TOUSSAINT LOUVERTURE)
c’est un homme seul qui fascine l’épervier blanc de la mort blanche 
c’est un homme seul dans la mer inféconde de sable blanc
c’est un moricaud vieux dressé contre les eaux du ciel
La mort décrit un cercle brillant au-dessus de cet homme
la mort étoile doucement au-dessus de sa tête
la mort souffle dans la canne mûre de ses bras
la mort galope dans la prison comme un cheval blanc
la mort luit dans l’ombre comme des yeux de chat
la mort hoquète comme l’eau sous les Cayes
la mort est un oiseau blessé
la mort décroît
la mort vacille
la mort est un patyura ombrageux
la mort expire dans une blanche mare de silence.

Here is a schematic view of the plot of Act 2 and 3 in "the scaffold" divided by episodes:

I. Act 2 (Saint Domingue)

a. A parade of officials and clergy praise Toussaint. The latter responds with disdain and turns the crowds against the hypocritical elites (42-46).
b. A group of white passersby complain about being ruled by a black general (48-50).
c. Toussaint expresses his dissatisfaction to CRR, who try to reassure him of his accomplishments (51-53).
d. White armies debark, leading to a new stage of the revolution: After a failed meeting with ‘Parliamentarians’, a new confrontation begins between the black armies and what is implied to be the armies of Napoleon (58, 60-61).
e. Toussaint’s troupes are forced to retreat to the bush to engage in guerilla warfare (62-63).
f. Over a scorched land, Toussaint sings of doubt while CRR sings the devastation (64-66).
g. The *Acte* ends with an encounter between Toussaint and a set of underground and celestial voices prophesying Toussaint’s imprisonment and death (67-68).

II. Act 3 (France)

a. (In prison) Toussaint encounters his jailers (74-75).
b. Toussaint resists the offers of the messenger of the consul (78-80).
c. Toussaint confronts his son, who has been educated in France and tries to convince his father to compromise with his captors (85-88). 
d. Toussaint is tortured and dies at the hands of his jailers (96-101). 

As the reader can see, when we bring these episodes together with those  of "Revolution rising" and `P2`, we have a coherent story. With the exception of the order of the segments in Act 1, we also have the general structure of the final version of the typescript. What additions come after "the scaffold" are mostly local. Césaire will reframe Act 2 several times, and the general tenor of the drama changes as the CRR plays an increasingly central role next to Toussaint, but the overall edifice remains the same.

The theme of temptation that will characterize all of the published versions of the drama is already dominant at this stage. The major difference between the typescript and the published versions is that temptation does not only present itself to Toussaint, but to the crowds as well.
