[tl;dr: I make a bet that I can do genetic analysis on just one typescript, in this case, the first witness for Aimé Césaire's "Et les chiens se taisaient"; I introduce the text around Césaire's paradox of freedom and situation, because one shouldn't just do scholarly work of the 10 year variety because of a bet; I dive into the genesis of the text by framing its composition between 1941 and 1943 based on archival and textual evidence; a thorough codicology of the salient material features of the text follows; I reverse-engineer the pagination schemes of the witness, and combine it with the evidence gathered in the codicology to divide the genesis into nine stages of composition, pretty visualization and all.]

[The chapter is ready for review. I invite willing readers to refine me by fire.
