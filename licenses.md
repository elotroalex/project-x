If you are sure that the sequences of characters are original to me, consider them public domain. Glad to be the one to free themâ€”I just regret not offering you more useful ones. If you are an academic, you should consider citing me anyway to avoid a different sort of trouble.

I have taken liberties with fair use in this work essential to making my arguments. The work itself places a question mark around existing copyright regimes. If you feel I've infringed on your rights, though, I would be happy to take down the offensive material. Just let me know at colibri.alex &#9671; gmail.
