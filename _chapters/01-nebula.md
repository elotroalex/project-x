### opening gambit

All origin stories imply another origin: the origin of the tale. The setting was a small, chic office in the Place de la Sorbonne, belonging at the time to the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie. The year was 2008, and a small team of editors had gathered to plan an ambitious new edition of Aimé Césaire's works. The debate hinged on the choice between a genetic[^a2] or a critical approach. Only a handful of those in the room were familiar with the traditions of textual scholarship that gave meaning to that distinction. Among them was Pierre-Marc de Biasi, who among other accomplishments, was already known as a virtuoso of la *critique génétique* for his work on Flaubert. He was hesitant. 

"You just can't do good genetic critique without enough scraps of paper" he offered, suspicious of the 20th century—and I quote from memory, so he probably didn't say that exactly. "Yes you can!" I retorted, speaking out of turn and breaking ranks. "If you pay close attention to the material cues in a typescript, you can do it." He wasn't convinced, so we made a bet: 5 euros[^b1]. Below are my receipts... 

...

In one of those ironic twists in the annals of literature, Aimé Césaire worked on *Et les chiens se taisaient* more than on any other text throughout his writing career only to have it be his most neglected. We can understand why the text was so important to him. In all the different versions that come down to us, published or unpublished, the central figure in the text is a rebel who refuses to compromise with the pretensions of power. For Césaire the poet and anti-colonialist, this fundamental antagonism provided a source, an opening. He was aware of it too. This much is clear from an interview he gave François Beloux in 1969: 

> Mais cette première pièce, je ne la voyais pas "jouée" ; je l'avais d'ailleurs écrite comme un poème. Cependant, ce texte présente pour moi une profonde importance : parce que c'est une pièce très libre et située dans son milieu—le milieu antillais. C'est un peu comme la nébuleuse d'où sont sortis tous ces mondes successifs que constituent mes autres pièces.[^a1] (28)

*Au bout du petit matin*... we should take Césaire at his word—the fib will become apparent soon enough. At the most basic level, the most recognizable themes in his œuvre are indeed already prefigured in *Et les chiens se taisaient*: anti-colonialism, freedom, revolution, *nègritude*, words as weapons, Haiti. Even more a propos is the dichotomy he sets up between freedom and place. Freedom, juxtaposed to place, slips into its opposite without replacing it—an anchored flight from place: *fuga estática de la poesía*. The vehemence of his response to Beloux double sanctions a reading of his works where this paradox becomes the source question: how can a text be both free and situated? Some might rightly build an answer out of the notion, found in his early essay "Poésie et connaissance," that poetic freedom is a miraculous weapon reconciling self and world to produce a richer truth than science. Such a commendable reading already bares the seeds of another answer: freedom, as the fugitive virtue of a text, is sourced from a particular situation.

The *nébuleuse*, an astronomical soup of clashing dust particles and gases can be read as a metaphor for atelier, as workshop more than work, but also as a distant and diffuse birthplace in need of navigation. The bewildering shift of *Et les chiens se taisaient* from a very situated historical play about the Haitian Revolution (~1941-1943) to a highly iconoclastic lyrical oratorio centering an iconic rebel (1946), later re-situated for a larger market for books and stagings (1956), provides an exemplary case for exploring the tension between the freedom of text and the bind of place, and by extension, the genetic process that will situate the rest of Césaire’s work—and my own.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/timeline">A timeline of events</a> surrounding the working and reworking of "Et les chiens se taisaient" shows two major clusters of intense activity, when the major transformations to the text took place. The first period extends from ~1941 to 1946. In these years, Césaire created the historical drama based on the Haitian Revolution[^a3] that introduces the title "...et les chiens se taisaient." In 1944 he begins to transform this work into the “*oratorio lyrique*”[^a4] that will represent its first published version as part of the poetry collection *Les Armes miraculeuses* (1946). In the second period, from 1954 to 1956, he develops the two other major versions of the work: the collaborative piece created with Janheinz Jahn, *Und die Hunde schwiegen* (1956), widely distributed and performed in Germany, and the “arrangement théâtral” published in Paris (1956). In a dizzying chain of textual events, these four major versions trace a journey from historical particularity to an oneiric universalism, and on to what we may be tempted to call a reconciliation of the two in the attempts to stage it at the height of the 1950's anti-colonial movements.

Addressing particulars and universal aspirations in their storylines, the dramas gathered under the rubric *Et les chiens se taisaient* were produced—and continue to be reproduced—under very peculiar circumstances. While these material traces may complicate our view of the text—or texts—any worthy attempt to find ourselves there, *Wo Es war*, in the crumbling flesh of archives and flash of circuitry, remains one of our best hermeneutical gambits. Aimé Ferdinand David Césaire—now canonized, pantheonized, just Césaire—had to negotiate many different editorial horizons before his texts opened to a world market for literature and ideas. His words are repeated now in bytes crossing the oceans by submarine cable, in many cases fragmented beyond repair in the password protected boxes of global finance. As expected, the drama of that emergence also bears the scars of these shifting contexts. The freedom of a text is here as elsewhere tempered by the extent and make-up of the playing field. But we get ahead of ourselves...

### the thick spit of centuries

We have reason to believe that Césaire started work on "...et les chiens se taisaient"[^1] sometime in 1941, during the height of l'Amiral Robert's infamous regime in Martinique. The major indication comes from the typescript itself. Defying his captors, Toussaint Louverture, the main character of the early version, asks them to spit on him “*l'épais crachat des siècles/ mûri/ en 306 ans*” (76).[^2] Rewinding from 1941, this odd number gives us 1635, the year Martinique and Guadeloupe were appropriated in the name of the French Crown by Pierre Belain d'Esnambouc. The “thick spit,” aged 306 years, could reasonably refer to the time that Martinique has been under French domination.

The number 306 could also point to 1492, if we date the years back from 1798, the year that Toussaint signed the treaty with the English, which falls within the fictive timespan covered in the play, and which the first act mentions. One reason to prefer this interpretation would be Toussaint’s address to “Colomb” in the early parts of the play. Alas, the number 306 comes from a scene in *Acte III*, when Toussaint is already in prison in the Jura Mountains, or as the historical record would have it, in 1802. The paradoxical anachronism of the first interpretation, on the other hand, plays well with similar anachronisms meant for a Martinique audience found in the text, as we shall see below. Thankfully, we don’t need to decide one way or the other categorically between these two justifications, since both calculations work to some extent.

A couple of years before 1941, Aimé and Suzanne Césaire had returned to Martinique from their student-years in Paris, where his “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal” had just been published in the journal *Volontés*. As soon as they returned, he began to teach secondary school at the recently opened Lycée Schœlcher in Fort-de-France. In April of 1941, almost a year after Petain came to head the *État Français*, through the collaboration of Aimé, Suzanne, René Ménil, and Aristide Maugée, the first issue of the journal *Tropiques* would see the light of day. Soon after the publication of *Tropiques* Nº1, the *Capitaine Paul Lemerle* would anchor in Martinique, bringing with it André Breton, Wifredo Lam, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Victor Serge, and a host of other intellectuals fleeing the war. Césaire would meet Breton and Lam soon after their arrival in Martinique in one of the most famous chapters of twentieth-century literary history.[^3] These new friendships, forged in the matter of a few precarious weeks, would soon become avenues for new collaborations, but even more importantly perhaps, they would allow Césaire to project his artistic ambitions outside the confines of Vichy Martinique.

From 1940 to 1943, Martinique went through a period of "intense invention," as Édouard Glissant put it in an interview,[^4] which can be clearly linked to the political, social and economic conditions brought on by Petainiste ultraconservative colonial policies. As Eric Jennings has recently argued, rather convincingly, this "form of colonialism steeped in social-Darwinist determinism and rooted in a reductionist, organic understanding of other, usually 'primitive,' societies and 'races'" had many unintended (and thus greatly under-acknowledged) consequences (1): ideas of hyper-nationalism and folklorism were quickly reappropriated by the colonized; anti-universalist discourse became the foundation for particularist strands of intellectual activity; and last but not least, the harsher policies fueled anti-colonialist sentiment across the French colonies. The productions of Césaire and his circle during these years confirm Jennings' analysis: The journal *Tropiques* makes a nudge in the direction of folklorism and nationalism, even as early as its first issue;[^5] *Tropiques* also became a space to discuss and embrace philosophies of difference, including Frobenius’ anthropology of Hamitics and Ethiopeans (S. Césaire 27-32). In addition, the rabid censorship under l'Amiral Robert's government can be cited as the main cause for the journal's oblique style, while the regime’s tighter grip on the black populace accounts for the journal’s hyper-antagonism. 

All of the above applies more specifically to the typescript, "...et les chiens se taisaient." Because the drama was written in secrecy, its language seems to have been inversely influenced by the politics of censorship. The typescript makes explicit what *Tropiques* cannot afford to. With the refrain "*mort aux blancs*"[^6] framing the retelling of Haitian resistance against French ambitions, the play confronts head-on the lies of colonialism and imperialism, providing a great counterpoint to the subterfuges and misdirections of the published material of the time. On the other hand, the typescript still contains much poetry that was typical of Césaire's contribution to *Tropiques*, effectively creating a rift in the text between straight-forward and oblique language, cum poetics.

Beginning in 1941 and increasingly in 1942, a US naval blockade prevented the Germans from having access to the island—and as some claim, to a French cache of gold stashed in Fort-de-France. This effectively isolated Martinique. The only form of communication with the outside world came by way of a couple of ships that were allowed passage after an agreement between the Americans and Admiral Robert.[^7] Correspondence was then carried by post and sometimes by intermediaries. This situation must also be taken into account when we try to understand Césaire's strategies of publication and composition once he began corresponding with Lam in Cuba and Breton in New York. Undoubtedly, the access to external editorial environments becomes even more vital under the watchful eye of state censorship, however weak. 

The play evidences a struggle between the freedom to speak frankly without censorship and the idea of a poetry free from traditional form and subject. The text under censoring eyes desires to speak directly to the subjugated audience. In several scenes of the play, Toussaint addresses the black crowds in the language of truth to power. On the other hand, the freedom that Césaire seeks in poetic language cannot be reduced to direct address for long. As a result, the trope of freedom is caught in a bind, and we cannot talk about one without the other. Undoubtedly, this drama could not see the light of day in Martinique during the rule of Admiral Robert, but the possibility of it being published was nevertheless present to Césaire thanks to his lifelines in Cuba and New York. As a result, the political bent of the typescript seems stronger in its earlier stages than in later ones. If indeed the process of moving away from the history of the Haitian Revolution, as I hope to show, started during the draft stage of the typescript, we may have further circumstantial evidence that composition began in 1941.

Luckily, we find more precise information about the completion of the typescript in a cache of letters from Césaire to Breton housed at the Bibliothèque Litteraire Jacques Doucet. The first of these letters to mention the play is postmarked September 23, 1943, where Césaire notes he has just finished “*un drame nègre*.”[^8] A letter dated November 16, 1943 announces the impending arrival in New York of a package containing “*un recueil possible de poèmes ainsi qu’un drame : Et les chiens se taisaient*.” The next letter from Césaire (17 Jan. 1944), announces the arrival of some supplementary pages for "Et les chiens se taisaient" consisting of the short text “Intermède.” The Césaire documents at the Fonds Yvan Goll in Saint-Dié des Vosges, France, where the typescript is housed today, do not include this shorter piece. This suggests the possibility that sometime between November and January, Breton lent the typescript to Yvan Goll. 

The story of how Yvan Goll became involved in the editorial life of Césaire in New York has been superbly narrated by the scholar and former curator of the Goll archive, Albert Ronsin[^9] in his article “Yvan Goll et André Breton.” After making amends with Breton many years after they came to blows over who had invented *surréalisme* first, they both began collaboration on a special issue of Goll’s journal *Hemisphères*. This happened at the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1944, around the time Césaire sent his typescript. Both Goll and Breton had spent time in the Caribbean en route to New York, both had something to say about it, and each had columbused a black poet: Nicolás Guillén for Goll and Aimé Césaire for Breton. Issue 2/3 of *Hemisphères* would include Breton’s introduction to Césaire, “Un grand poète noir,”[^10] Césaire’s own “Purs sang,” and an announcement on the back cover for an upcoming edition of Césaire’s “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal,” translation by Yvan Goll.[^11] Good relations between Goll and Breton would not last long after this new collaboration. In May of 1944, while working together on the translation of the *Cahier*, they had another, final falling out.

The correspondence makes clear that the relationship between Breton and Goll was above all editorial. This is evident from Breton’s business-like responses to Goll, and Goll’s constant editorial proposals to Breton. Breton did not seem to respect Goll’s artistic judgment, nor did he seem to value the awkward friendship. Given the nature of their collaboration, and the fact that Breton was already using Goll to publish Césaire, chances are that the busy Breton loaned Goll the "Et les chiens se taisaient" typescript in hopes that the latter would adopt the project. The publication, of course, never materialized, and [gasp!] Goll never returned the typescript to Breton, despite the latter’s repeated entreaties and the intercession of their mutual friend Robert Lebel. In his last letter to Goll (12 Dec. 1944), Breton reminds Goll that he has asked for the typescript of "Et les chiens se taisaient" three times already. That is the last we hear of this typescript until 2008, when a footnote in Ronsin’s article prompted me to travel to Saint-Dié des Vosges. 

Because the dossier Césaire at the Fonds Yvan et Claire Goll does not include the short piece “Intermède,” it is safe to say that the integral Saint-Dié typescript was part of the package that Césaire announced in mid-November of 1943. This is our safest date for the completion of this version. In the next chapter, "you will assimilate to me," I provide further arguments to support this date.

When we consider the size of the text—107 loose leaves + title page—the completion date also reinforces the argument that the text was begun in 1941. A text of this size is larger than all of Césaire’s combined output up to that date, from his first journalistic pieces in Paris as a young man, to the 1939 edition of “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal,” to his contributions in *Tropiques*.[^12] Considering the enormous tax on his time that made him such a successful and dedicated teacher (Ngal 111-113) and his already substantial literary activity in *Tropiques*, we cannot but be astonished by this hitherto unknown work, which without a doubt, was Césaire’s most ambitious effort up until that point.

### codicology for typescripts

The main set of clues about the composition of the Saint-Dié typescript comes from the different pagination schemes added and deleted throughout its pages. To reach a genesis proper, though, we must supplement our study of the pagination with a close look at the different sorts of paper, carbon paper, writing utensils, page layouts and the text itself—in short a robust codicology of the typescript. This traditional material analysis of the typescript yields a de-composition into its smaller structural units—its bibliographic code, pace McGann—which can enable us to manipulate the text to yield the secrets of its genesis. 

Except for the actual text, all of the material evidence is detailed and organized in a series of codicological tables below.[^13] All of the rows in the tables, except for the headers, represent a page. These are organized from top to bottom in the order in which they are found today in Saint-Dié des Vosges—what we could call for brevity's sake, *the Saint-Dié witness*. This order also corresponds to the pagination scheme labeled `Page`. 

The first table ([table a]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-a/)), lists the support materials used for the typescript. The text as we find it is composed of 108 loose sheets, including the title page. I recognize a total of four (or five, depending on how you look at it) different types of paper. I have marked these as `Paper A`, `A+`, `B`, `C` and `D` in the table. The most common type is `Paper A`, thin, of a yellowing white hue (21.6 x 28 cm). Those pages marked `A+` have sheets of the same material as `A`, except they are slightly bigger. `Paper B` and `C` belong to two self-contained segments in *Acte I*. Paper B is thin and pink (21.6 x 27.8 cm). The twenty leaves made of this paper are only found towards the beginning of the play as it stands now. `Paper C` follows `Paper B` in the current pagination, and it is thin and white with a light blue tint (21 x 27 cm). Last, but not least, `Paper D` seems to have been introduced at a late stage of composition, and mostly appears in revisions made to *Acte II*. This paper is thick white and also yellowing, at times with rough-hewn edges, indicating the leaves came from a larger sheet. (22.4 x 28 and 21.6 x 28 cm).

The document seems to be, for the most part, a copy of a missing original, and traces of carbon paper are visible in almost every page. At least two kinds of carbon paper were used: blue and black. The traces of carbon paper residue in the typescript vary in intensity: at some points the paper is very dirty, at others very clean. None of the patterns align with other patterns we find in the pagination schemes, neither with the type of paper, nor with the type of revision instrument, which leads us to conclude that Césaire had a consistent supply of two types of carbon paper. Some pages are marked `orig`, for original, because we can't perceive any carbon residue on them—or at least without more scientific rigor. These pages mostly place towards the end, and indicate a late stage of the process.

The text was also revised using a variety of instruments. All of these are catalogued in [table b]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-b/) according to the pages in which they were used.

The witness has interesting features which push the boundaries of traditional codicology, and yet make fine additions to our catalogue of material evidence. These range from the regular, to the highly peculiar. Some of the regular features are listed in [table c]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-c/). For example, some pages end half-way through, usually marked with a large X drawn across the empty bottom space of the page. I flag these in the table as `Half Pages`. These pages often give us clues about the insertion of a page in a previous sequence, and sometimes help us isolate blocks of texts that work as independent units.

Starting on page 41, and intensifying after page 60 of the current pagination, the typist[^b2] tries to use as much of the blank real state on the paper as possible, sometimes schewing the line towards the end of the page, as the paper begins to slip from the platen roller. Perhaps paper became scarcer during the later stages of composition? Perhaps the household became more frugal? This marked difference in the use of paper is indicated in *table c* as `Max Use`.

{% include image.html
    img="fig-m.png"
    title="slanted text"
    caption="figure l | oh, well" %}

The last of the regular features is the uneven use of underlines under the speakers, marked in the table as `Underline`. This pattern is consistently used on the pages composed using `Paper B`, then dissappears for a while, only to intensify during the composition of the middle pages on `Paper A`. This quirk may indicate two typists, or simply two coherent periods of composition. Further evidence suggests the latter, but we cannot rule out the former. 

The Saint-Dié witness also yields many not-so-regular material clues, some helpful, some odd. We still don't know the typewriter that was used, but some clues point in that direction. The type in page 52 and 62, for example, is slanted—as if the paper locating guide was missing, or simply ignored. On many of the pages where carbon paper was used, four evenly-spaced columns of residue are visible to the naked eye. What machine produced such effects? A Remington? A Japy?

Other traces suggest working methods. On page 70, for example, blue ink bleed matching the corrections on page 69 suggests the pages were stacked in order when the revisions were made. The verso of page 71 is a reverse mirror image of the front of the page, suggesting the typist accidentally placed a second, black carbon paper facing the wrong way. This means also that at least 3 copies of that page were attempted using the sandwich method: the missing original, (with blue carbon paper behind), our First Copy (with the flipped black carbon paper behind), and a missing third. 

Some traces, alas, remain a mystery, like the words "*notions de base*" in all caps and underlined, in the back of page 75.

... 

We are now ready to retreive the main key: pagination. In total, we can count ten different pagination schemes spread throughout the typescript. The schemes are numerated using a variety of writing tools at the top of the pages. Some pages have several sets of numbers on them. Except for the library’s numeration, all numerations seem to come from Césaire’s hand. The last numeration added by Césaire determines the actual order of the pages as we find them today (**MAIN**[^14] in Table A, far-left column). In the following narrative this numeration will provide our canonical reference and will be indicated by a page number in parentheses.[^15] The page sequence established by **MAIN** is reinforced by the added pagination of a Saint-Dié des Vosges librarian, which I assume to be A. Ronsin. I’ve divided the rest of the numbering into two groups, early and late. The late paginations (**Late A**, **Late B** and **Late C**) begin when **Late A** introduces a continuous numeration that encompasses and organizes most of the text as we find it now, going from **Late A** 1 to **Late A** 103. The early ones (**Early A**, **Early B**, **Type**, **Early C** and **Early D**) mark a period of reorientation and experiment, where whole sections will change relative position or be heavily revised. The different pagination numbers also provide us with the principal criteria for re-organizing the text into smaller blocks to help us orient our genetic analysis of the text.

Figure 1. - Late C (MAIN)

In order to best understand the process by which we arrived at the current pagination, I’ve created a visualization in the form of a table, Table B ([link](https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?hl=en&hl=en&key=0AmgLcm5jfVhSdFNaQ2lvYUVsa0ZhVWx2NTJYTDZfSnc&output=html)),[^16] using all of the information (paginations, patterns) in Table A to reconstruct the order of composition of the pages in the typescript. As in Table A, the rows in Table B represent individual pages. In this case though, the order of the pages from top to bottom is relative, in the sense that the numbering system found on the farthest left column stands for different orders at different periods of time. Each of the colored columns in Table B represents the state of the text at different stages of development, extending from left to right from the earliest pagination (**Early A**) to the final pagination (**MAIN**). For example, under the column labeled **Early A**, the colored cells represent only a total of 18 pages. In my estimate, these pages were the first 18 to be written. All other cells in this column are empty because at this stage nothing else existed. The page numbers belonging to each stage are written in black in the columns immediately to the left. The numbers in gray correspond to either missing pages or page numbers marked in an earlier pagination scheme, which are assumed to be inherited for the current pagination scheme. Missing pages are devoid of color. Below I provide rationale for the genetic reconstruction of table B.

As I suggested, the most likely candidate for the first segment composed by Césaire corresponds to the 18 pages marked **Early A** (23-40).[^17] The handwriting used for this pagination is different from Césaire's usual handwriting, and it can be found on the top left of its pages, very close to the corner. The pagination comprises a segment of 18 pages marked from 1 to 20, with pages 3 and 4 missing. To reiterate, the pagination is indicated on the table by the black numbers to the left of the **Early A** column. The segment begins without the heading “*Acte*” written at the top of page 1, as all other pages marked 1 (or the equivalent in the continuous numeration) do. At this early stage, we have no evidence that Césaire envisioned his work in progress as a three-act drama. The kind of paper used, Paper C, is also not present in any other scheme. Only in one other case does a specific kind of paper correspond to a specific pagination scheme, Paper B and Early B.

Three features of the content also suggest that **Early A** was the earliest segment: a) Page 1 begins with stage directions that set the scene “*à Saint-Domingue*,” announcing the general setting for *Acte I* and *II*; b) The episodes in the segment roughly align with the early period of the Haitian Revolution; and c) The segment contains the least amount of poetic interventions by Toussaint, the chorus and/or the reciters of all the drama, providing the most straight-forward episodes of the whole. If indeed **Early A** was the first batch composed, this last feature suggests that the original orientation of the drama gravitated towards a popular theater. Even if it remains to be seen whether the completed text is suitable for the stage or not, this segment would certainly be the most accessible to the general public.

Next in the genetic order we have **Early B**. All the pages with **Early A** numbers (23-40) were shifted down in the overall structure of the text by the insertion of those pages marked with pagination **Early B**. The strongest evidence comes from the fact that **Early B** is only separated by a difference of one from the final numeration. As opposed to the pages of **Early A,** the pages of **Early B** remained approximately where its own numeration indicated they should be.

In addition, circumstantial evidence suggests the **Early B** pages were composed after the pages of **Early A** were finished. If we were to claim that **Early B** was composed prior to **Early A**, then we would have to conclude that **Early A** was not meant to be the beginning of *Acte I*. The evidence does not support this conclusion. The reader will remember that **Early A** begins with the number 1, and at no point until **Late A** does this change. Why would Césaire begin at number 1 what will be page 23 if he had meant for this new text to be a continuation of **Early B**? Perhaps **Early A** was written as an alternative beginning to **Early B**. After all, both retain their low numbers until **Late A**. Perhaps **Early A** was meant to be the beginning of *Acte II*. The problem with these hypotheses is that the internal evidence within **Early A**, analyzed above, does not support them. A much simpler explanation is that **Early B** was written after Early A. Furthermore, as we shall see below when we take a closer look at the content of **Early B**, its historical action followed at one point the historical action of **Early A**, before falling prey to the mighty pencil.

Neither can we at this point prove with empirical certainty that the **Early B** pages were composed before any of the others, though that order of composition also seems likely. Present in *Acte I* only, the numbers of **Early B** were written in pencil on the top-left corner, going sequentially and uninterrupted from 3 to 23 (2-22).[^18] Just as in **Early A**, the pages of **Early B** correspond to one unique type of paper. In this case, the paper is a very distinct pink, Paper B. The next pagination in the series, **Early Type**, provides further reason to believe that **Early B** should come second in the series. The numbers of **Early Type** were typewritten on the top-left corner of the page. This pagination can be found exclusively in segments belonging to *Acte II* and *III*. If **Early B** was written after **Early Type,** I don’t see why it wouldn’t have followed suit and marked its pagination in type as well. It seems probable that the pages of **Early B** were written as those of **Early A**, before the final structure started congealing, leaving the pagination blank during the typing, and adding it later in pencil, after the overall edifice started to take shape.

**Type** will eventually be replaced by **Early D** and **Early C**, with pagination now written on the top-right corner. Since we can be fairly certain all other paginations inhabiting the same pages as **Type** are posterior to it, we can be confident that **Early D** and **Early C**, which overlap for the most part with **Type**, mark a later stage of development in the structure of the text. Top-right pagination for **Early B** would have aligned it more with this middle period. The case being the opposite, the top-left pagination groups it with the earlier stages. Since **Type** was also marked in the top-left corner, albeit with type, it was possibly meant to be brought in sync with **Early B**.

Regardless of the placement of the pagination, if **Early B** was written after **Early Type**, (still a possibility) this means that it was not written with a clear sense of where it belonged, even after the overall structure was becoming clear to Césaire. It would also entail that Césaire started using Paper A to compose **Early Type**, then switched to paper B to compose this strange section without a home, to return to Paper A for **Early C** and **Early D**, leaving pink paper behind. This seems unlikely. The more reasonable conclusion is that the pages of **Early B** were written before the composition of *Acte II* and *III,* and therefore before **Early Type**, **Early C** and **Early D**.

Thus far, while arguing for the position of **Early B** in the sequence, we managed to place **Early Type, Early C** and **Early D** as well. As we approach **Late A** —where Césaire unites all acts under one sequential numeration for the first time— we should note that all three acts follow a different genetic pattern (Table B). *Acte I* and *Acte III* are different from each other in that the first joined two blocks of text sequentially, like cutting a deck of cards, while the last intercalated text in the crevices of an early structure, like shuffling it. *Acte II* evidences a much more complex genetic process. While *Acte I* and *Acte III* attain their stability soon enough, after **Late A** the middle act continued to be reworked, prompting changes in what was clearly meant to be a final sequence. Notwithstanding, by the time we arrive at **Late A,** the text has clearly achieved a structural landmark.

Although the changes to *Acte II* could be considered minor in relation to the whole text, they are not so relative to *Acte II* itself. As you can see from Table B, the changes after **Late A** comprise about 1/4^th^ of the final text of *Acte II*. Several of these changes are also attempts at reframing the act. Starting with **Late A** 68, and following with **Late C**’s 41 series —41, 41’, 41’’ and 41’’’— we see an effort to change the way the act begins and ends.

Determining which came first, **Late B** or **Late C,** has not proved to be an easy task.[^19] Each of the segments was corrected with a different (and rare) writing utensil, **Late B** with red pencil, and **Late C** with a dark pen. However, they both use the same kind of paper that comes into play after **Late A**, Paper D. Moreover, while both have blocks of pages that relocate before the final organization, the transpositions of the former take place in the middle of the text, while the transpositions of the latter take place around the frame, making it difficult for us to determine their relative order of composition.

Finally, the **MAIN** pagination adopts most of the numbering of **Late A**, some of the one from **Late C** and **Late D**, and shifts the overall numeration down to accommodate the extra pages inserted after **Late A**. This is how we receive the typescript today, despite Césaire’s best efforts to erase all traces of this early work.

On The Practical Uses of Virtual Versions.
------------------------------------------

After all the pieces of the puzzle have been laid out on the table, and a picture of the different blocks of pages emerges, we can start thinking about each of the stages, represented by each of the columns in Table B, as virtual versions of the text. We can define a virtual version as a version of the text captured at a given moment in an imaginary genesis, and reconstructed from the current material state of a text. A virtual version can be constructed, for example, by choosing the blocks of pages of **Early A** and **Early B**, without the corrections in ink, but with the corrections in pencil. Even if computers make it relatively easy for us to generate many virtual versions, the exercise could still be useful to scholars working without the technology.[^20]

In order to understand the development of the typescript from what I see as its beginnings as a full-blown historical drama to the mixed text we find in Saint-Dié, and as an example of what we can gain from virtual versions, I want to revisit the reconstruction of the genesis, this time focusing on the drama itself.

### Virtual Version A: The Revolution is the Subject

As noted above, the pages marked with **Early A** contain the largest number of historical references: names, locales and events which correspond more or less to the early period of the Haitian Revolution. The curtain opens on a plantation in Saint-Domingue (Haiti). A few white girls play outside. The Chorus, a Reciter, and a Recitress enter the stage to warn the girls of impending dangers: “*Rentrez chez-vous jeunes filles, il n’est plus temps de jouer, les orbites de la mort poussent des yeux fulgurants à travers le mica blême.*”[^21] The girls respond to that poetical warning in plain French: “*C’est une devinette?*”[^22] After two further, brief exchanges, the girls begin to mock the odd strangers: “*Hou, hou*.”[^23] The mother appears at the door and, sensing the true danger of the situation, asks the girls to come inside. Thus begins the earliest form of the drama.

In the next scene, the Chorus, the Reciter, and the Recitress bury an imaginary body while reciting the words “*Adieu, Saint-Domingue*.” The mock burial sets the stage for the carnage that characterizes the drama. Combined with the preceding episode, these initial gestures set Saint-Domingue as the main subject of the story. This frame is completely different from the one we get in all future versions. For example, as early as **Early B**[^24] the frame changes to focus on the death of Toussaint (Le Rebelle in published versions). In other words, though Toussaint was an important character from the beginning, the earliest conception of the work suggests a drama centered on the historical event proper.

Another notable feature of **Early A** is its theatricality. After the reciters bury the imaginary body of Saint Domingue, we have the following stage direction:

> *(A ce moment l’obscurité envahit la scène; des coups de feu; des cris discordants; puis le tapage s’apaise peu à peu; quand la lumière revient, le décor a changé: le camp des nègres au milieu d’une forêt. Chefs nègres et députés blancs en conférence).*[^25] (24)

The instructions are specific to a staged spectacle. Each of the lines refers to sound, lighting, or décor, with only one adjective thrown in the mix, “*discordants*.” Compare the sentence, for example, to a parallel passage towards the beginning of the first published version:

> *(Dans la barathre des épouvantements, vaste prison collective,  peuplée de nègres candidats à la folie et à la mort; jour trentième de la famine, de la torture et du délire).*[^26] (98)

These lines, by contrast, do not contain a single element that would facilitate staging in an actual theater, despite the dark appeal of the scene in the reader’s imagination. Even the line ‘collective prison’ is wrested from the stage by the adjective ‘*vaste*.’ Although I am not interested at the moment in arguing that the typescript is suitable for the stage, something I believe can only be tested by the stage itself, it seems clear to me that **Early A** gravitates towards a theatrical representation. Other stage directions in our virtual version support that conclusion, with a limited amount of (debatable) extra-theatrical elements found on the directions on page 15 (35) and the last page, 20 (40).[^27]

**Early A** uses two kinds of narrative modes: either the story develops through the action and dialogue of the characters on stage, or it is narrated by the Chorus/Reciter/Recitress trio (CRR). We will shortly come back to the diegetic narrative, one of the keys to unraveling the transition from history to myth in the text. In the mimetic narrative, we count three large episodes. As the white delegates begin to lay their diplomatic traps, Toussaint invites them to address the black troupes directly. The crowds seem to waiver after the seductive pleas of the delegates to disarm them, but Toussaint sways them by signaling their devious intentions. Once persuaded of the righteousness of their cause, the crowds unleash their machetes and the refrain which will echo throughout the rest of the drama: “*Mort aux blancs*!” Death to the whites.[^28] The delegates are massacred, and the rebels descend on the rest of the white population with their sharp response.

After a brief CRR recitation, rife with ghoulish visions of the revolutionary bloodbath, the scene moves to an assembly of planters at Cap \[Français\] presided over by the governor. In their arrogance, the white planters continue to underestimate the situation. The governor (Blanchelande[^29] in the episode) fails to bring them to their senses. On the streets, passersby echo the haughtiness of the assembly. Soon after, the tumult of the revolution bursts onto the scene. The episode continues with a mock-assembly of black interlopers, or as the text has it “*une séance sinistre et bouffonne pleine d’emphase et de cruauté.*”[^30] The episode ends as another group of rebels walks into the assembly with the head of the governor on a pike.

After another CRR recitation, the final, and rather brief, staged narrative brings us back to the beginning of **Virtual Version A**, with the mother and the girls now running for cover. The scene quickly changes to a field of slaves who ‘sing their fatigue’ in call and response for two pages. The virtual version ends with a CRR recitation, and what seems to be, at least on the surface, the most extra-theatrical stage direction of **Virtual Version A**: a ship in distress invades the field of vision, and in the phosphorescent sea an inscription explodes: *République d’Haiti.* As we will shortly see, this cinematic technique fits a particular theatrical modality available in the 1940's.

I summarize these three episodes not only to help the reader enter this difficult text through the most accessible door, but to make a few important points about them in relation to the history of the text. The first point is that Toussaint is not the central figure initially, but rather one character amongst many in a dramatization of events of the Haitian revolution. The second point is that these episodes are meant to suggest the first stages of the revolution: a committee negotiating for leaders to be set free at the expense of the rank and file, the assembly at Cap Français unaware of the gravity of the situation, the massacre of white populations by revolted slaves, when slavery itself reigned supreme in Saint Domingue —In brief, the most basic retelling of the early stages of the revolution.

Other details which barely catch our attention confirm that we are dealing with the early days of the revolution. During the assembly of planters, the governor warns that “*Toussaint et Boukmann ont constitués une armée*.”[^31] This places us around the year 1791.[^32] Notice also that at the end of **Early A** 2 (24), paragraph was marked for deletion with red ink. The lines in question were to be delivered by a second French delegate, who was to propose freedom for the leaders. At this point, two pages are missing from Early A, pages 3 and 4. As the action returns on **Early A** 5 (25), Toussaint asks Dessalines[^33] to stand back (also erased with red ink). This suggests that the two missing pages carried details of the negotiations between the white delegates and other leaders besides Toussaint, Dessalines being the one who survives by name. The historical Jean Jacques Dessalines was involved in the revolution from the start, and his appearance here is consistent with the history of the early revolution. Leaving aside for now the historical incongruities which students of the revolution will immediately recognize in these dramatizations, these effaced leaders further testify to Toussaint’s marginal role in this virtual  ersion.

Towards the end of **Early A,** during the last recitation, the Reciter announces that Sonthonax has opened the prisons, armed the slaves, and opened the doors to several important cities. This refers no doubt to the most famous deed of the Civil Commissioner, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, to declare an end to slavery in Saint Domingue under the pressure of revolutionary forces. This places the end of the segment around October 1793. In retrospect, **Virtual Version A** forms a non-Aristotelian[^34] dramatic unit which can be said to follow a chronological order consistent with the historical record.

Nothing within **Early A** would place the action outside the span 1791-1793, except for one anachronism which deserves brief notice since it reinforces the third point I want to make: that, at this stage of its development, the work is oriented towards the theatre. I am referring to the song “À la Martinique,” hummed by one of the voices on the street outside the assembly of planters on page 13 (33)[^35]:

> *A la Matinique, Matinique, Matinique \\
> c’est çà qui chic...*

This character is paying homage to the famous *café-concert* singer
Felix Mayol, who popularized the song in France at the beginning of the twentieth century. The complete version tells the story of a black man from Martinique who falls in love with a flower shop attendant and becomes a boxer to satisfy her demand for jewelry and pretty dresses. The song was originally composed in English by George M. Cohan, the “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” for an American minstrel show. [^36] Not surprisingly, the lyrics present several racist stereotypes of the time. What is more important to us is that Césaire makes a direct reference to Music-Hall, and an indirect reference to minstrelsy. How familiar this song was to Martinique audiences is difficult to ascertain, especially when we consider the song was already thirty years old by the time our text was produced. This is, nevertheless, a familiar theatrical gesture. Paired together with the slave song towards the end, the performance echoes and demands a stage.

The next theatrical detail that deserves attention is an odd stage direction on **Early A** 19. The Recitress narrates: 300,000 rebels attack the city, white crowds jam the main gates, trying to reach the ships in the harbor. A stage direction interrupts the narration: “*A mesure qu’elle parle, tout cela se dessine sur l’écran*.”[^37] This stage direction will later be erased by pencil. While it lingered there, however, it opened up the text to an intermediation that hardly belongs in a closet drama.

The use of the screen to project images, and more important, film on the theater stage can be traced back to the ‘cinemagician’ Georges Méliès[^38] at the beginning of the century, but it is Erwin Piscator who will make it a prominent theatrical practice in 1920s Weimar Germany. Although several critics have pointed out the Brechtian inflections in Césaire’s theater,[^39] very little attention has been given to Brecht’s collaborator and friend Piscator, who developed a different conception of ‘Epic Theater’ from Brecht, one that depended on stage machinery, film projectors, large crowds on stage (*Sprechchöre*), and a political style marked by didacticism and documentary modes.

In the absence of documentary evidence, I find it difficult to ascertain whether Césaire knew the work of Piscator (or Brecht) during his years in Paris. Piscator remained in Paris to avoid Stalin’s Great Purge for the two years that Césaire was a student at the École Normale Superieure, but (to my knowledge) he does not seem to have staged or published while he was there. Much more likely, Piscator’s innovations came to Césaire’s attention via Paul Claudel’s *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb*.[^40] Although the latter drama was not staged until much later, the book was published by Gallimard during Césaire’s years in Paris, with two runs in 1933 (one with illustrations by Jean Charlot, the other *sans*) and a reprint in 1935.[^41] Claudel was so taken with Piscator’s experiments that he had asked him to collaborate on *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb*. That collaboration never took place, but the influence of the one on the other remains evident.[^42]

The resonance between Césaire’s and Claudel’s own “*théâtre total*” seems over-determined: an evident overlap between the *dramatis personae*, early traces of similar techniques, and more importantly, perhaps, a dialectical negation of Columbus in *Chiens,* who will become the explicit nemesis of **Early B**[^43]*.* The tension between these two texts deserves a longer treatment than we can supply in this study. For now, what should draw our attention is the use of the screen in Claudel’s drama. The screen is present from the beginning of his play “*au fond de la scène*,” [^44] arguably serving a dramatic, didactic, and choral role, in Brecht’s acceptation. Although Claudel invokes the screen more often than Césaire’s lone example, their functions overlap. Here is an example from Part I, scene x of *Le Livre*: “*Tout cela apparaît mélangé sur l’écran*” (46).[^45] Both Césaire and Claudel —using almost the same formula— project on a screen whose function is both mimetic and diegetic, and whose main trope is the χορός, here understood not as a separate role within the drama, but the corralling of all roles singing in unison. In other words, for Césaire and Claudel, the chorus sings *in chorus* with the screen.

This brings us back to the late stage direction in **Early A** where the words “*Republique d’Haïti*” are projected unto a phosphorescent sea and which, as already noted, seems to belong to later developments of the text. Presumably written before the pencil corrections that will excise most of the work’s theatricality, this stage direction elicits the phantasmagorical return of the earlier screen. The projection of letters itself being a famous Piscator technique, the soon-to-be un-mountable stage direction becomes a moment of negotiation between the stage and the poetry that will characterize future stage directions. The transition from the stage to the poetry marks a replacement of the mechanical (i.e. the screen), for the imagination, and as a consequence, from the theatre to the text.

As I pointed out above, the Chorus and the Reciters intrude between the dramatic episodes, establishing a rhythm of sorts between them and the action. As **Virtual Version A** begins, they engage with the girls on the stage, but besides this brief metalepsis, they remain outside of that action. Their words, nevertheless, are in constant dialogue with the events being dramatized on stage. For the most part, these intrusions from CRR consist of narrative or commentary. Though they speak in a highly elliptical poetic idiom, CRR is clearly describing and referring to events which are either being already depicted on stage or are related to it. In this sense, the role of the Chorus does not depart substantially from the chorus in classical Greek theater. On the other hand, the introduction of a Reciter and a Recitress does modify somewhat the traditional role of the *κορυφαῖος*. Nevertheless, in their triangular dynamic, CRR echoes the strophe, anti-strophe and epode of the ancient plays.

Although the Greek tragedy which should elicit most of our comparative attention is probably the *Prometheus Bound*, our chorus goes beyond the role of the Chorus of Daughters of Oceanus and their relationship to Prometheus —at least at this stage of the composition. I would tentatively suggest that the Chorus of **Virtual Version A** is more like Sophocles’ Chorus in his Theban plays since it represents the polis, speaks prophetically, and has a direct relationship to the central character.

Once the episode with the delegates begins, after the two missing pages and after Toussaint invites the delegates to address the crowds, the Reciters barge on the scene to foreshadow the response of the crowds and the bloodbath to come:

> *Déja le silence empoisonne chaque fibre\\
> Des gestes hiéroglyphes avalés à moitié signalent\\
> Les jachères et les semis de cadavres* (25).[^46]

After the crowds have raised their war cry and the episode with the
delegates ends, CRR takes over the narration of the event:

> Le récitant: Un coup de sifflet... Les nègres sortent des broussailles\\
> avec\\
> une grande clameur. Les coutelas s’abattent et se relèvent et s’abat­\\
> tent dans le moulinet de l’exaspération (29).[^47]

These two examples support an important point about the history of the text, perhaps the one with the most repercussions. The first example, which we could call proleptic, and the second, which we could call diegetic, both refer to the action on the stage, to an unfolding plot for which they are a doubling of sorts (in the same way that the ‘screen’ was a doubling of the Chorus). This crucial function of the Chorus will soon change, and as all reference to historical events is eventually lost and the plot reduced almost to the point of stasis, we will end up with a much more poetic choral function. While the Chorus of the print versions can be quite baffling—and has been for readers—seeing the earliest form of the Chorus in action can provide a great point of departure for us to understand its future avatars.

The principal theme of the Chorus in **Virtual Version A** is the revolution itself, and most of their diegetic recitations describe the epic events that cannot be represented on stage. This reinforces two of the points that we made above: that the revolution is the subject of **Virtual Version A**, and that at this stage of composition diegesis and mimesis supplement each other in traditional ways. Finally, and providing a certain level of internal coherence, the Chorus opens and ends this segment, first to bury the old Saint Domingue, and as the act comes to a close, to welcome the Republic of Haiti.

### Virtual Version B and C: Toussaint King

> *En me renversant, on n’a abattu à Saint-Domingue que le tronc de\\
> l’arbre de la liberté des noirs ; il repoussera, parce que les racines\\
> en sont profondes et nombreuses.*

Attributed to the historical Toussaint Louverture.

Virtual versions do not need to be constructed out of one pagination scheme alone. In fact, we could create virtual versions that are not defined by pagination schemes at all. To be precise, a virtual version is a reduction of a given historical document to the text encompassed by one or more discrete codicological or bibliographic features. This definition excludes free-form recreations of the text. In theory, we could reconstitute texts in infinite ways, à la Césaire. Notwithstanding, for the idea of a virtual version to remain useful for genetic analysis, we must limit our recreations to plausible states of the existing document. A virtual version made up of only handwritten revisions, for example, would be useless.

As I will argue in more detail in Chapter 3, our reorganizations should be accompanied by a clear and meaningful set of rules justifying the new formations. Although text in general can be said to be always-already marked up by different codes, we reconstitute that mark-up by a set of exhaustive rules or algorithms that in turn define the contours of the new blocks of text. Those rules find their basis in a number of dimensions: codicology (Chapter1 and 2), bibliography (Chapter 2), hermeneutics (Chapter 1, 2 and to a lesser extent, 3), string-comparison (Chapter 3), and many others. Regardless of the criteria, the imperative remains for us to be purposeful, explicit and rigorous in our method of selection.

In the following, I use two pagination schemes and all revisions made to it to construct two virtual versions, which I will then use to further explore the erosion of the historical referent in the genesis of the text and the rise of Toussaint as the central figure of the drama.

I call **Virtual Version B** the text paginated with the number set labeled **Early B**, without revisions. This also means that we are to take the text without the pagination itself, and assume that the pages were meant to follow **Early A**.[^48] To construct **Virtual Version C**, I want to take all the pages in **Early B** together with the first page added during **Late A** and all the revisions made on the combined text. In other words, pages 1-22 of MAIN in their current state. The first page, added by **Late A**, was written to replace what was originally **Early B** 1 and 2 (now missing), and conforms very well with the rest of **Early B**. Together they form a coherent analytical whole.

At some point, **Virtual Version B** was set during the middle period of the Haitian Revolution, with references to Toussaint’s takeover of the Spanish part of the island, the defeat of the British forces, and an enactment of Toussaint’s capture. From an historical point of view, this is the most confused and confusing segment. In a later revision, all references to the middle-to-late period of the Haitian Revolution will be erased, and with a few masterful strokes, Césaire will bring the action to the early period of the French Revolution, the temporal setting of **Virtual Version C**.

If we take **Virtual Version B** by itself, the action takes place sometime during Toussaint’s campaign in the Eastern part of the  island (1801):

> *Le choeur: Mon oeil se dore de visions souveraines..... Toussaint\\
> fait son entrée solennelle à Santo Domingo.....Le cavido\\
> lui remet les clefs de la ville*.[^49] (11)

 ven though they are framed as a vision, while the action remains solidly within a coherent temporal framework, these lines can be interpreted as the sort of typical *pragmatographia* found in **Virtual Version A**. The fictional timeline will soon change, and with it the rhetorical and poetic function of similar lines. In the meantime, we can already hear the potential for disassociating the action on the stage from the pseudo-historical narrative built into the diegetic function of the chorus in **Virtual Version A**. Once you remove the mimetic action on the stage that authorizes and gives meaning to them, lines such as these transform into a peculiar form of detached *ecphrasis*; soon enough, when the geographical and historical references disappear as well, these ostensive lines end up being removed completely or disfigured to refer to a vague archetypal history of the African diaspora and colonialism. My next chapter explores this phenomenon in the context of Césaire's international audiences.

At some undetermined late moment in the genesis of the typescript, the temporal progression of **Virtual Version B** undergoes a radical shift. On the first page of **Late A**, the type sets the scene geographically, “*La scène est à Saint Domingue*.” Césaire will eventually add “*à l’epoque de la Révolution française*”[^50] by hand next to it. In order to make the rest of the text conform to this new temporal reorientation, Césaire will make use of his pencil. The first such revision comes on **Late A** 2 (2),

> *Le Chœur: Hurrah. Les Anglais sont perdus... Nos batteries d’approche\\
> balayent leurs remparts; nos batteries de brèche sont intallées...\\
> Saint-Marc craque... comme un vaisseau pourri...*[^51]

The rest of the pencil revisions will continue in the same spirit. On **Early B** 14 (15), at the end of **Early B**, the last line changes two times, making things even more complicated: “... *La Grande Révolution de Saint Domingue ~~continue~~ ~~a commencé .~~vient de commencer*” (22). At one point, the revolution continued, at another it had begun, and finally it had *just* begun.

To accommodate this recasting, many internal changes had to be made, most notably, the grammatical tense, which changes in several places from *passé composé* to *futur simple*: 

> *Toussaint: ~~J’avais amené~~ ^j’amenerai^ ce pays à la connaissancede\\
> lui-même,\\
> je familiaris~~é~~ ^erai^ cette terre avec ses démons secrets\\
> ~~allumé~~ ^j’allumerai^ aux cratères d’hélodermes et de cymbales\\
> les symphonies d’un enfer inconnu, splendide\\
> parasité de nostalgies hautaines...*[^52] (14)

We should note in passing that this can be used as further reason that **Early B** was written after **Early A**. The tense is adapting to the temporal model established by **Early A**. In the first version of **Early B**, the action follows **Early A**, therefore the past tense is appropriate. As the timeframe moves to the French Revolution, the tense appropriately changes to the future. The passage refers, of course, to Toussaint’s past or future involvement in the Haitian Revolution. Several other changes will confirm this temporal reorientation, with the strange consequence that the narrations of CRR become *proleptic*, or as I have no reservations calling them, prophetic.

The most salient aspect of **Virtual Version B** is perhaps the introduction of Toussaint Louverture as a central character. This virtual version unfolds in four distinct episodes. We do not know exactly what the first two pages of **Early B** contained. When the action resumes on **Early B** 3 (2), the Reciter and Toussaint have the stage.

The Reciter begins with a trope, prevalent throughout the drama, that I would like to call for now —with T.S. Eliot’s permission— *the revolutionary correlative*: a poetic vision of violent/revolutionary phenomena, drawing its vehicles from nature. It is safe to say that these tropes characterize a large part of the poetry of CRR and Toussaint, and we will have more to say about them later on. Here is the example that opens **Early B**:

> *En marge des marées sautillantes, je marche sur l’eau des printemps\\
> tournants ; j’aperçois très haut mes yeux de sentinelle. L’insomnie à\\
> toute épreuve grandit comme une désobéissance le long des tempes\\
> libres de la femme à l’emphore, verseau, verseau tempête de germes,\\
> bouilloire*.[^53] (2)

Toussaint Louverture trails these lines by making himself the locus of the violence, in a poetic sequence where he becomes intertwined with the landscape around him. On the next page, the scene is grounded roughly at the moment when the city of Saint-Marc surrenders, and the Reciter announces the arrival of the messenger of the king[^54] who would have a word with Toussaint.

In the next episode, Toussaint encounters three “*voix tentatrices*”[^55] who offer him riches and titles, in a scene reminiscent of the temptation of Christ, but more to the point, the temptations of Job. The theme of temptation will become the dominant structuring feature of all published versions of the text, with other lures confronting the Rebel. Already in the typescript we have several such encounters, the delegates of **Early A** being the first. There is much to be said about this particular episode in **Early B** where the would-be devils comment on the seductiveness of (their) language. In terms of the history of the text, the scene is important because it will reframe/reinforce the scene with the delegates of **Early A**, as a scene of seduction. Furthermore, this scene sets up a struggle between the ‘beautiful’ words of deceit and the avowedly ‘truthful’ poetry of Toussaint. Once this struggle is in place, it becomes possible to read the whole drama as a battle for words themselves.

Following the temptation, Toussaint and CRR will engage in a series of long exchanges over freedom, truth, revolution, sight, and a series of other dominant themes. The result of this long exchange is that we start moving away from any purported historical action to a poetic recasting of the hero as the center of the revolution. CRR declares Toussaint a king, and in the same breath, CRR predicts his death. Toussaint accepts his fate and vows to die “naked.” Just as he laments that his message might fall on deaf ears, he meditates on the reverberation of radical action. This is also the episode where Toussaint names his enemy as “Colomb” and addresses him in lines of exquisite anguish.

In the final episode Toussaint confronts the crowds. They arrive on the stage ready to burn Toussaint. Rabble-rousers attempt to convince them that Toussaint is putting their lives in danger (yet another temptation), but Toussaint is able to sway them to the fight at hand by harshly scolding them for their cowardice. At the end of the episode the revolution continues, or is about to begin, or has just begun, but it is no longer the central focus of the play. The internal struggle of Toussaint the hero has taken over, and with this twist, historicity (and chronology) begin to erode.

### Virtual Version D: The concise drama.

I would like to end my analysis with one more virtual version. It goes without saying that many other constructions can help refine our genetic analysis of the typescript. In fact, by ending our analysis of virtual versions here, we are ending it in the middle of the process that produced the typescript as we know it. I encourage the future student of the text, using the tools and precedents that I have laid out, to generate their own intermediary steps and perhaps correct or offer an alternative to my narrative.

Let us define **Virtual Version D** as those pages organized around and up to **Early D** (including **Early A**, **B**, **Type** and **C**) and excluding the extra-typographical revisions. To construct **Virtual Version D** we will also assume that those pages marked **Early B** have not received their pagination yet, and follow the pages marked with **Early A**. This effectively organizes the action in **Virtual Version D** chronologically, starting with the early days of the Haitian Revolution, moving on to the defeat of the English, and ending with Toussaint’s death in the Jura mountains.

Two features stand out in **Virtual Version D**: a) Four sections all roughly about 20-26 pages long (**Early A** and **B** are considered here different sections). This contrasts with the three acts of the final version of the typescript, averaging 35 pages an act; b) and following from (a), **Virtual Version D** is a coherent, albeit shorter, drama. In order not to repeat myself unnecessarily, I will just focus on *Acte II* and *Acte III* since we have studied in some detail the substance of *Acte I* (**Virtual Versions A** and **B**).

Here is a schematic view of the plot of *Acte II* and *III* in **Virtual Version D** divided by episodes:

I. *Acte II* (Saint Domingue)

a. A parade of officials and clergy praise Toussaint. The latter responds with disdain and turns the crowds against the hypocritical elites (42-46).
b. A group of white passersby complain about being ruled by a black general (48-50).
c. Toussaint expresses his dissatisfaction to CRR, who try to reassure him of his accomplishments (51-53).
d. White armies debark, leading to a new stage of the revolution: After a failed meeting with ‘Parliamentarians’, a new confrontation begins between the black armies and what is implied to be the armies of Napoleon (58, 60-61).
e. Toussaint’s troupes are forced to retreat to the bush to engage in guerilla warfare (62-63).
f. Over a scorched land, Toussaint sings of doubt while CRR sings the devastation (64-66).
g. The *Acte* ends with an encounter between Toussaint and a set of underground and celestial voices prophesying Toussaint’s imprisonment and death (67-68).

II. *Acte III* (France)

a. (In prison) Toussaint encounters his jailers (74-75).
b. Toussaint resists the offers of the messenger of the consul (78-80).
c. Toussaint confronts his son, who has been educated in France and tries to convince his father to compromise with his captors (85-88). 
d. Toussaint is tortured and dies at the hands of his jailers (96-101). 

As the reader can see, when we bring these episodes together with those  of **Virtual Version A** and **B**, we have a coherent story. With the exception of the order of the segments in *Acte I*, we also have the general structure of the final version of the typescript. What additions come after **Virtual Version D** are mostly local. Césaire will reframe *Acte II* several times, and the general tenor of the drama changes as the CRR plays an increasingly central role next to Toussaint, but the overall edifice remains the same.

The theme of temptation that will characterize all of the published versions of the drama is already dominant at this stage. The major difference between the typescript and the published versions is that temptation does not only present itself to Toussaint, but to the crowds as well. The steadfastness of Toussaint/Le Rebelle in the face of temptation contrasts with the crowd’s vulnerability, for whom Toussaint plays the role of Platonic educator. In this sense, the typescript explores the Promethean theme more thoroughly than the published versions by staging several encounters between Toussaint and the crowds. Later versions will rely more on the structure of *Prometheus Bound*, with Le Rebelle ‘bound’ in prison from beginning to end, making the promethean figure the center of our attention at the expense of the event.

Although **Virtual Version D** already evinces a shift in emphasis from the historical narrative proper to the heroic and poetic subject, the text preserves history as a referent. Critics have remarked, and this can be readily verified, that Césaire was not very rigorous in his citations. Because he is oftentimes inaccurate, especially in his reconstruction of the events in our text, we are left wondering whether the problem lay with his sources or whether he was actively engaging in myth making.

An effort is currently underway, most notably under the initiative of professor Jean Jonassaint of Syracuse University, to try to reconstruct Césaire’s readings on the Haitian Revolution based on clues found in his oeuvre. One of the most fascinating features of our typescript —especially the beginning segment of *Acte II*, which comes into play in **Virtual Version D**— is the presence of quotes (not always in quotation marks) from historical sources. These quotes are placed in the mouth of a series of random characters and—of course—no citation is given.

Here are two citations I have been able to identify:

> *2è orateur: Gloire à Toussaint Louverture, le Spartacus noir, le nègre prédit par Raynal pour venger les injures faites à sa race.* (42)

This line comes at the beginning of the episode, after the first orator has praised Toussaint for delivering the land from the tyrannical English. Ironically, the line from the second orator comes from the British evangelist Marcus Rainsford's *An historical account of the black empire of Hayti* (1805). Here are Rainsford’s words: "General Laveaux called him 'the negro, the Spartacus, foretold by Raynal, whose destiny it was to avenge the wrongs committed on his race'" (247).

The next exact match comes in quotes:

> Le grand Maitre de l'Université: Gloire et reconnaissance à Toussaint Louverture éducateur du peuple ! Libre à un Villaret-Joyeuse de fermer les écoles dans la Martinique voisine et de déclarer cyniquement : "L'ignorance est un lien nécessaire pour des hommes enchainés par la violence ou flétris par les préjugés".[^56] (43)

The quoted lines came originally from the *Capitaine-General* of Martinique and Saint-Lucie, Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, in a proposal to close down the schools under his jurisdiction. The original document was first published in 1861 in Augustin Cochin’s *L’Abolition de l’esclavage*. Other nineteenth-century books dealing with the question of slavery will reprint the lines, and I have not been able to determine whether Césaire copied it from Cochin or from later reprints of Villaret’s communiqué.[^57] The important point is that Césaire is using verbatim quotes from historical sources. This sort of ‘documentary’ approach was also one of the main innovations of Piscator for the theater, and reinforces some of the points we made earlier about Césaire’s use of avant-garde techniques. Although, as Attilio Favorini has demonstrated, the so-called documentary theater can be traced back to the Greeks, its modern incarnation in the work of Brecht and Piscator links it directly to questions of social justice, the role of crowds on stage, and other features more appropriate to Césaire’s drama.

Before moving from the typescript to the many other subsequent transformations of the text, we should briefly examine one last feature of **Virtual Version D**. As Table B shows, *Acte III* is about half of what it would be when we reach pagination **Late A.** At this stage, it ends with Toussaint’s death and not with Dessalines continuation of the revolution, and it is missing a couple of recognizable episodes, especially the hallucinatory intrusion of “Le Grand Prohibiteur.” The setting and action of *Acte III* will, for all intents and purposes, replace the historical settings in the published versions. At this early stage, the structure of the final act already echoes the overall structure of the text: Toussaint must ward-off the temptations coming from the enemy (the messenger), from his own people (his son), and from a divine being (the Holy Virgin). This simple structure of temptation will carry over in all other reincarnations of the drama. The echoes in both structure and theme will eventually make it easy for Césaire to bring all the action to the prison cell and leave the Haitian Revolution behind.

Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolution were evoked as early as the 1939 version of the “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal”. Considering the importance of these two themes, their elision in the 1940’s should still give us pause. In 1960 Césaire will publish his biography of Toussaint, *La Révolution Française et le problème colonial*, which doubled as an analysis of the revolution, and which was an important contribution at the time. Soon thereafter, his first successful play, *La Tragedie du Roi Christophe*, resumes the story of the revolution where the narrative of the typescript ended. Though we have seen how Césaire began to distance his text from history, the possible why must wait for my next chapter.

Through systematic codicological and textual analysis, I have argued that the shift away from the events of the revolution and the transformation of Toussaint Louverture into an abstract Rebel began while the typescript was being drafted. The argument means to demonstrate the value of using rules-based virtual reconstructions for the study of complex modern manuscripts. In the next chapter, we will take a broader perspective on some of the themes explored in this chapter, in an attempt to answer the why and not the how of Césaire's move away from history. To accomplish our goal, we will address more familiar, and therefore less controversial textual unities (the book, the poem, the article, the preview, etc.) and their attendant geo-temporal complexities. In other words, we will move away from the decomposition and comparison of the one document with itself, to the comparison of many documents with each other.

[^5]: This explains in part Césaire's article on Peguy and selections from his poetry in the first issue of *Tropiques*. In the article, Césaire defended Peguy for his nationalist love of the peasantry. Because Peguy had been appropriated by the Petainistes, Césaire could maneuver a message of Martinican particularity using him as a stand-in for a nationalism rooted on the peasantry. Let us not forget that it was Peguy who said "*Je ne veux pas que l'autre soit le même, je veux que l'autre soit autre. C'est à Babel qu'était la confusion, dit Dieu, cette fois que l'homme voulut faire le malin*" (*Œuvres poétiques complètes*. Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 60. Paris: Gallimard, 1941.) These words echo Césaire's own anti-assimilationism in the first issue of *l'Etudiant noir*: "Jeunesse Noire, il est un poil qui vous empêche d'agir : c'est l'Identique, et c'est vous qui le portez." This reading is, of course, complicated by the fact that Césaire had already praised Peguy for his "heroïsme" in another article published in Paris in 1939 (“Le Message De Charles Péguy.” *LʼAction Surréaliste* 53 (1939): 2). That other article ends with the words, "à Suivre," which imply that the Tropiques article is the announced continuation. The point remains, that the different reasons for praising him fall on different audiences, and that in both cases a peculiar reading is possible.

[^6]: \[Death to the whites\]

[^7]: Traffic seems to stop altogether in 1942 when the US ships cut off all access to the island for several months as the Germans intensified their campaign. This explains in part a gap in the correspondence between Césaire and Breton from April 20, 1942 to January 10, 1943.

[^8]: My gratitude to René Henane for allowing me to consult his transcriptions of the correspondence and for his generous friendship.

[^9]: I owe a great debt of gratitude to his widow, Nadine Ronsin, who has taken over the role of curator of the Goll collection in her husband’s stead. She has welcomed me on two occasions to the peaceful small town in Lorraine —where town lore would have it, the name America was uttered for the first time in history—with the sort of hospitality that inspires the best in others. I also thank her colleagues at the Bibliothèque Municipaple de Saint-Dié des Vosges for providing a comfortable work space and a pleasant atmosphere for the days of arduous scanning and research.

[^10]: We learn from the letters that “Un grand poète noir” was written at the behest of Goll as a possible introduction to the *Cahier d’un retour au pays natal*, by a somewhat unwilling Breton, who didn’t consider *Hemisphères* to be the appropriate vehicle for such a text. This short tribute to Césaire will go on to have a life of its own in several other publications since, most notably as the introduction of the Brentano’s edition of *Cahier d’un retour au pays natal* and as a chapter in Breton’s *Martinique, Charmeuse de serpents*.

[^12]: This statement remains true in so far as we have not yet recovered his thesis on Black Southern writers in the United States, and can only speculate how much effort he put into it. Not much would be my guess.

[^b2]: I have not been able to establish the identity of the typist, despite inquiries to more senior scholars who knew the poet, or analysis of the typos.

I put $5 on it.  

[^13]: Here's the [source data for the complete set of codicological tables]({{site.baseurl}}/data/codicology-st-die-witness.csv), in case you would like to use you're own software to view it or manipulate it.

[^14]: As we will see shortly, **MAIN** inherits most of **Late A** until page 55. What I am calling **MAIN** is a combination of page numbers from **Late A**, a few pages of **Late B** and **Late C**, and page numbers written at the last stage of pagination. In Table A, in the column named **MAIN**, the page numbers which are inherited are written in gray in order to distinguish them from those written at the time when the text received its final organization.

[^15]: Other numbering systems will be indicated by name + page number. Sometimes the `Page` number will follow in parenthesis. Ex. **Late A** 55 (56) is the same as ‘the page with the number 55 in the number set labeled **Late A**, and the number 56 in **MAIN**.’

[^16]: <http://bit.ly/g6Auzu>

[^17]: As I indicated at the beginning of the chapter, the numbers in parentheses represent the **MAIN** pagination. In this case, these pages were originally numbered 1, 2…20. That would be the **Early A** numbers. In the final ordering they became 23, 24…40. This would be the **MAIN** numbers.

[^18]: We assume the existence of Early A 1 and 2, but these have disappeared without a trace.

[^19]: I’ve marked that ambiguity with an inverted curly bracket in the table.

[^20]: [Virtual versions coming soon]

[^21]: \[Go back inside, girls, playtime is over, the orbits of death
    push their fiery eyes through the pale mica\]

[^22]: \[Is it a riddle?\]

[^23]: This is the French equivalent of “Boo” in English. In other words, the girls are imitating the sounds of ghosts in mock-scary.

[^24]: We can't say with certainty how Early B originally began because we are missing the first two pages.

[^25]: \[(At that moment darkness engulfs the stage; gunshots; discordant cries; gradually, the disturbance settles down; when the light returns, the décor has changed; the black camp in the middle of a forest. Meeting of black chiefs and white deputies.)\]

[^26]: \[(In the chasm of fright, a vast collective prison peopled with *nègres,* all contenders for madness and death; thirtieth day of the famine, the torture and the delirium.)\]

[^27]: On page 15 we find, for example, a stage direction describing the smell of blood, and another, immediately after, describing the silence that falls on the stage as rigid and funereal. On the last page we find one of the most fascinating stage directions in the whole typescript and I discuss it directly later in the chapter. Page 15 and the last page, 20 (40), also share another peculiarity in addition to their extra-theatrical stage directions. They are the only two pages in **Early A** without any dark pencil corrections. We should note also that half of the parentheses around stage directions in **Early A** were added in pencil, especially on the first 6 pages, pages 12 (32), 17 (33) and 18 (34). An argument can be made that these pages represent yet an earlier stage than the rest. Page 15 and 20 are, of course, probably the latest of **Early A**.

[^28]: This refrain will play a pivotal role in the trajectory of the drama. As we will see in Chapter 2, Césaire tones down the rhetoric when he publishes the text in an international context. Although, I do not address it directly in Chapter 3, Césaire assigns a couple of stanzas in 1956 to the Rebel which question the wisdom of this rallying cry.

[^29]: Philippe François Rouxel, vicomte de Blanchelande, was governor of Haiti when the revolution began. Unlike the Blanchelande of the play, Philippe was sent back home to France in September of 1792. In 1793 he faced trial for treason and was eventually guillotined.

[^30]: \[A sinister and buffoonish gathering, full of bombast and cruelty.\]

[^31]: In a later revision, Boukman gets crossed out in dark pencil, leaving Toussaint to build an army by himself.

[^32]: The historical Dutty Boukman was killed in November of 1791, and as far as I know, he did not fight alongside Toussaint.

[^33]: Jean Jacques Dessalines was the most important leader of the revolution besides Toussaint Louverture.

[^34]: Ironically, the more ‘avant-garde’ version of 1946 will reclaim all three Aristotelian units of time, space and action.

[^35]: The song is mockingly reprised on page 15 (35) by the vengeful crowds of slaves. See also footnote 28.

[^40]: I’m engaged at the moment in a lively debate with Pierre Laforgue precisely over this issue. He has recently finished a wonderful article on Césaire and Claudel which we should expect to see in print soon. While he quite rapidly sold me on the connections between *Tête d’or* and *Le Soulier de satin* and *Et les chiens se taisaient*, I have been slower to convince him that the major dialogue between Césaire and Claudel takes place around *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb.*

[^41]: Claudel, Paul. *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb.* Ed. Michel Lioure, Paris: Gallimard (2005) p.208

[^43]: Columbus also makes an important apparition in Jahn's adaptation. The echoes between Jahn's contributions in the 1950's and the early text, which Jahn never saw, continue to amaze me.

[^44]: \[In the back of the stage\]

[^45]: \[All of this appears mixed together on the screen\]

[^46]: \[The silence already poisons every fiber/Half-swallowed hieroglyphic gestures signal/The plowing and seeding of corpses\]

[^47]: \[The Reciter: A whistle… The blacks exit from the brushes with a great uproar. The cutlasses clash and they are raised again and they clash in the reel of exasperation.\]

[^48]: Note that this is not marked up on Table B, which in a sense conflates pagination schemes with order of composition. The reality is not so. While the pages were composed early, the **Early B** pagination probably came much later. Considering the historical setting in this segment, they were also probably meant to follow **Early A**.

[^49]: \[The Chorus: My eye is gilded with sovereign visions… Toussaint makes his solemn entry in Santo Domingo. The *cabildo* hands him the keys to the city.\] Césaire misspells the Spanish word *cabildo* (twice). A *cabildo* was a Spanish form of local government best understood as a colonial administrative council. It was indeed a Spanish *cabildo* in Hispaniola which surrendered to Toussaint Louverture in 1801.

[^50]: \[The scene is at Saint Domingue…at the time of the French Revolution\]

[^51]: \[The Chorus: Hurrah! The English have lost… Our batteries of approach sweep their ramparts… our breaching artillery is in place… Saint-Marc cracks… like a rotten ship.\]

[^52]: \[Toussaint: ~~I had brought~~ I will bring this country to the knowledge/ of itself,/ I ~~familiarized~~ will familiarize this land with its secret demons/~~lit~~ I will light the craters of helodermes and cymbals/the symphonies of an unknown hell, splendid/infested with haughty nostalgias.\]

[^53]: \[On the margins of jolting waves, I march on the water of turning Springs; I perceive high up my sentinel eyes. Foolproof, insomnia grows like the disobedience along the free temples of the woman with amphora, aquarius, aquarius germ tempest, kettle.\]

[^54]: The king in question could be a reference to Napoleon who by 1801 was already in power. The choice of king is not at all surprising since that word will become a grab-all for all forms of supreme rule in the drama. In the following scene in particular, it is precisely that title which is offered to Toussaint.

[^55]: \[Voices of temptation\]
