## opening gambit

All origin stories imply another origin: the origin of the tale. The setting was a small, chic office in the Place de la Sorbonne, belonging at the time to the Agence universitaire de la Francophonie. The year was 2008, and a small team of editors had gathered to plan an ambitious new edition of Aimé Césaire's works. The debate hinged on the choice between a genetic[^a2] or a critical approach. Only a handful of those in the room were familiar with the traditions of textual scholarship that gave meaning to that distinction. Among them was Pierre-Marc de Biasi, who among other accomplishments, was already known as a virtuoso of la *critique génétique* for his work on Flaubert. He was hesitant. 

"You just can't do good genetic critique without enough scraps of paper" he offered, suspicious of the 20th century, but unwittingly evoking the history of colonial and anti-colonial archives—and I quote from memory, so he probably didn't say that. "Yes you can!" I retorted, speaking out of turn and breaking ranks. "If you pay close attention to the material cues in a typescript, you can do it." He wasn't convinced, so we made a bet: 5 euros[^b1]. Below is my first batch of receipts... 

...

In one of those ironic twists in the annals of literature, Aimé Césaire worked on *Et les chiens se taisaient* more than on any other text throughout his writing career only to have it be his most neglected. We can understand why the text was so important to him. In all the different versions that come down to us, published or unpublished, the central figure in the text is a rebel who refuses to compromise with the pretensions of power. For Césaire the poet and anti-colonialist, this fundamental antagonism provided a source, an opening. He was aware of it too. This much is clear from an interview he gave François Beloux in 1969: 

> Mais cette première pièce, je ne la voyais pas "jouée" ; je l'avais d'ailleurs écrite comme un poème. Cependant, ce texte présente pour moi une profonde importance : parce que c'est une pièce très libre et située dans son milieu—le milieu antillais. C'est un peu comme la nébuleuse d'où sont sortis tous ces mondes successifs que constituent mes autres pièces.[^a1] (28)

*Au bout du petit matin*... we should take Césaire at his word—the fib will become apparent soon enough. At the most basic level, the most recognizable themes in his œuvre are indeed already prefigured in *Et les chiens se taisaient*: anti-colonialism, freedom, revolution, *nègritude*, words as weapons, Haiti. Even more a propos is the dichotomy he sets up between freedom and place. Freedom, juxtaposed to place, slips into its opposite without replacing it—an anchored flight from place: *fuga estática de la poesía*. The vehemence of his response to Beloux double sanctions a reading of his works where this paradox becomes the source question: how can a text be both free and situated? Some might rightly build an answer out of the notion, found in his early essay "Poésie et connaissance," that poetic freedom is a miraculous weapon reconciling self and world to produce a richer truth than science. Such a commendable reading already bares the seeds of another answer: freedom, as the fugitive virtue of a text, is sourced from a particular situation.

The *nébuleuse*, an astronomical soup of clashing dust particles and gases can be read as a metaphor for atelier, as workshop more than work, but also as a distant and diffuse birthplace in need of navigation. The bewildering shift of *Et les chiens se taisaient* from a very situated historical play about the Haitian Revolution (~1941-1943) to a highly iconoclastic lyrical oratorio centering an iconic rebel (1946), later re-situated for a larger market for books and stagings (1956), provides an exemplary case for exploring the tension between the freedom of text and the bind of place, and by extension, the genetic process that will situate the rest of Césaire’s work—and my own.

<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/timeline">A timeline of events</a> surrounding the working and reworking of *Et les chiens se taisaient* shows two major clusters of intense activity, when the major textual transformations took place. The first period extends from ~1941 to 1946. In these years, Césaire created the historical drama based on the Haitian Revolution[^a3] that introduces the title "...et les chiens se taisaient." In 1944 he begins to transform this work into the “*oratorio lyrique*”[^a4] that will represent its first published version as part of the poetry collection *Les Armes miraculeuses* (1946). In the second period, from 1954 to 1956, he develops the two other major versions of the work: the collaborative piece created with Janheinz Jahn, *Und die Hunde schwiegen* (1956), widely distributed and performed in Germany, and the “arrangement théâtral” published in Paris (1956). In a dizzying chain of textual events, these four major versions trace a journey from historical particularity to an oneiric universalism, and on to what we may be tempted to call a reconciliation of the two in the attempts to stage it at the height of the 1950's anti-colonial movements.

Addressing particulars and universal aspirations in their storylines, the texts gathered under the rubric *Et les chiens se taisaient* were produced—and continue to be reproduced—under very peculiar circumstances. While these material traces may complicate our view of the work—or texts—any worthy attempt to find ourselves there, *Wo Es war*, in the crumbling flesh of archives and flash of circuitry, remains one of our best hermeneutical gambits. Aimé Ferdinand David Césaire—now canonized, pantheonized, just Césaire—had to negotiate many different editorial horizons before his texts opened to a world market for literature and ideas. His words are repeated now in bytes crossing the oceans by submarine cable, in many cases fragmented beyond repair in the password protected boxes of global finance. As expected, the drama of that emergence also bears the scars of these shifting contexts. The freedom of a text is here as elsewhere tempered by the extent and make-up of the playing field.

## the thick spit of centuries

We have reason to believe that Césaire started work on "...et les chiens se taisaient"[^1] sometime in 1941, during the height of l'Amiral Robert's infamous regime in Martinique. The major indication comes from the typescript itself. Defying his captors, Toussaint Louverture, the main character of the early version, asks them to spit on him “*l'épais crachat des siècles/ mûri/ en 306 ans*” (76).[^2] Rewinding from 1941, this odd number gives us 1635, the year Martinique and Guadeloupe were appropriated in the name of the French Crown by Pierre Belain d'Esnambouc. The “thick spit,” aged 306 years, could reasonably refer to the time that Martinique has been under French domination.

The number 306 could also point to 1492, if we date the years back from 1798, the year that Toussaint signed the treaty with the English, which falls within the fictive timespan covered in the play, and which the first act mentions. One reason to prefer this interpretation would be Toussaint’s address to “Colomb” in the early parts of the play. Alas, the number 306 comes from a scene in Act 3, when Toussaint is already in prison in the Jura Mountains, or as the historical record would have it, in 1802. The paradoxical anachronism of the first interpretation, on the other hand, plays well with similar anachronisms meant for a Martinique audience found in the text, as we shall see below. Thankfully, we don’t need to decide one way or the other categorically between these two justifications, since both calculations work to some extent.

A couple of years before 1941, Aimé and Suzanne Césaire had returned to Martinique from their student-years in Paris, where his “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal” had just been published in the journal *Volontés*. As soon as they returned, he began to teach secondary school at the recently opened Lycée Schœlcher in Fort-de-France. In April of 1941, almost a year after Petain came to head the *État Français*, through the collaboration of Aimé, Suzanne, René Ménil, and Aristide Maugée, the first issue of the journal *Tropiques* would see the light of day. Soon after the publication of *Tropiques* Nº1, the *Capitaine Paul Lemerle* would anchor in Martinique, bringing with it André Breton, Wifredo Lam, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Victor Serge, and a host of other intellectuals fleeing the war. Césaire would meet Breton and Lam soon after their arrival in Martinique in one of the most famous chapters of twentieth-century literary history.[^3] These new friendships, forged in the matter of a few precarious weeks, would soon become avenues for new collaborations, but even more importantly perhaps, they would allow Césaire to project his artistic ambitions outside the confines of Vichy Martinique.

From 1940 to 1943, Martinique went through a period of "intense invention," as Édouard Glissant put it in an interview,[^4] which can be clearly linked to the political, social and economic conditions brought on by Petainiste ultraconservative colonial policies. As Eric Jennings has recently argued, rather convincingly, this "form of colonialism steeped in social-Darwinist determinism and rooted in a reductionist, organic understanding of other, usually 'primitive,' societies and 'races'" had many unintended (and thus greatly under-acknowledged) consequences (1): ideas of hyper-nationalism and folklorism were quickly reappropriated by the colonized; anti-universalist discourse became the foundation for particularist strands of intellectual activity; and last but not least, the harsher policies fueled anti-colonialist sentiment across the French colonies. The productions of Césaire and his circle during these years confirm Jennings' analysis: The journal *Tropiques* makes a nudge in the direction of folklorism and nationalism, even as early as its first issue;[^5] *Tropiques* also became a space to discuss and embrace philosophies of difference, including Frobenius’ anthropology of Hamitics and Ethiopeans (S. Césaire 27-32). In addition, the rabid censorship under l'Amiral Robert's government can be cited as the main cause for the journal's oblique style, while the regime’s tighter grip on the black populace accounts for the journal’s hyper-antagonism. 

All of the above applies more specifically to the typescript, "...et les chiens se taisaient." Because the drama was written in secrecy, its language seems to have been inversely influenced by the politics of censorship. The typescript makes explicit what *Tropiques* cannot afford to. With the refrain "*mort aux blancs*"[^6] framing the retelling of Haitian resistance against French ambitions, the play confronts head-on the lies of colonialism and imperialism, providing a great counterpoint to the subterfuges and misdirections of the published material of the time. On the other hand, the typescript still contains much poetry that was typical of Césaire's contribution to *Tropiques*, effectively creating a rift in the text between straight-forward and oblique language, cum poetics.

Beginning in 1941 and increasingly in 1942, a US naval blockade prevented the Germans from having access to the island—and as some claim, to a French cache of gold stashed in Fort-de-France. This effectively isolated Martinique. The only form of communication with the outside world came by way of a couple of ships that were allowed passage after an agreement between the Americans and Admiral Robert.[^7] Correspondence was then carried by post and sometimes by intermediaries. This situation must also be taken into account when we try to understand Césaire's strategies of publication and composition once he began corresponding with Lam in Cuba and Breton in New York. Undoubtedly, the access to external editorial environments becomes even more vital under the watchful eye of state censorship, however weak. 

"...et les chiens se taisaient" evidences a struggle between the freedom to speak frankly, without censorship and the idea of a poetry free from traditional form and subject. The text under censoring eyes desires to speak directly to the subjugated audience. In several scenes of the script, Toussaint addresses the black crowds in the language of truth to power. On the other hand, the freedom that Césaire seeks in poetic language cannot be reduced to direct address for long. As a result, the search for freedom is caught in a bind, and we cannot talk about one without the other. Undoubtedly, this work, as play or text, could not see the light of day in Martinique during the rule of Admiral Robert, but the possibility of it being published elsewhere was nevertheless present to Césaire thanks to his lifelines in Cuba and New York. As a result, its bind to the Caribbean—audience and history—seems stronger in its earlier stages than in later ones. If indeed the process of moving away from the history of the Haitian Revolution, as I hope to show, started during the draft stage of the typescript, we may have further circumstantial evidence that composition began in 1941.

Luckily, we find more precise information about the completion of the typescript in a trove of letters from Césaire to Breton housed at the Bibliothèque Litteraire Jacques Doucet. The first of these letters to mention the play is postmarked September 23, 1943, where Césaire notes he has just finished “*un drame nègre*.”[^8] A letter dated November 16, 1943 announces the impending arrival in New York of a package containing “*un recueil possible de poèmes ainsi qu’un drame : Et les chiens se taisaient*.” The next letter from Césaire (17 Jan. 1944), announces the arrival of some supplementary pages for "Et les chiens se taisaient" consisting of the short text “Intermède.” The Césaire documents at the Fonds Yvan Goll in Saint-Dié des Vosges, France, where the typescript is housed today, do not include this shorter piece. This suggests the possibility that sometime between November and January, Breton lent the typescript to Yvan Goll. 

The story of how Yvan Goll became involved in the editorial life of Césaire in New York has been superbly narrated by the scholar and former curator of the Goll archive, Albert Ronsin[^9] in his article “Yvan Goll et André Breton.” After making amends with Breton many years after they came to blows over who had invented *surréalisme* first, they both began to collaborate on a special issue of Goll’s journal *Hemisphères*. This happened at the end of 1943 and the beginning of 1944, around the time Césaire sent his typescript. Both Goll and Breton had spent time in the Caribbean en route to New York, both had something to say about it, and each had columbused a black poet: Nicolás Guillén for Goll and Aimé Césaire for Breton. Issue 2/3 of *Hemisphères* would include Breton’s introduction to Césaire, “Un grand poète noir,”[^10] Césaire’s own “Purs sang,” and an announcement on the back cover for an upcoming edition of Césaire’s “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal,” translation by Yvan Goll.[^11] Good relations between Goll and Breton would not last long after this new collaboration. In May of 1944, while working together on the translation of the *Cahier*, they had another, final falling out.

The correspondence makes clear that the relationship between Breton and Goll was above all editorial. This is evident from Breton’s business-like responses to Goll, and Goll’s constant editorial proposals to Breton. Breton did not seem to respect Goll’s artistic judgment, nor did he seem to value the awkward friendship. Given the nature of their collaboration, and the fact that Breton was already using Goll to publish Césaire, chances are that the busy Breton loaned Goll the "...et les chiens se taisaient" typescript in hopes that the latter would adopt the project. The publication, of course, never materialized, and [gasp!] Goll never returned the typescript to Breton, despite the latter’s repeated entreaties and the intercession of their mutual friend Robert Lebel. In his last letter to Goll (12 Dec. 1944), Breton reminds Goll that he has asked for the typescript three times already. That is the last most of us hear of this typescript until 2008, when a footnote in Ronsin’s article prompted me to travel to Saint-Dié des Vosges. 

Because the dossier Césaire at the Fonds Yvan et Claire Goll does not include the short piece “Intermède,” it is safe to say that the integral Saint-Dié typescript was part of the package that Césaire announced in mid-November of 1943. This is our safest date for the completion of this version. In the upcoming chapter, "you will assimilate to me," I provide further arguments to support this date.

When we consider the size of the text—107 loose leaves + title page—the completion date also reinforces the argument that the text was begun in 1941. A text of this size is larger than all of Césaire’s combined output up to that date, from his first journalistic pieces in Paris as a young man, to the 1939 edition of “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal,” to his contributions in *Tropiques*.[^12] Considering the enormous tax on his time that made him such a successful and dedicated teacher (Ngal 111-113) and his already substantial literary activity in *Tropiques*, we cannot but be astonished by this hitherto unknown work, which without a doubt, was Césaire’s most ambitious effort up until that point.

## codicology for typescripts

The main set of clues about the composition of the Saint-Dié typescript comes from the different pagination schemes added and deleted throughout its pages. To reach a genesis proper, though, we must supplement our study of the pagination with a close look at the different sorts of paper, carbon paper, writing utensils, page layouts and the text itself—in short, a codicology of the typescript. Done with care and humility— *comme déterreurs de reliques*—this traditional material analysis of the typescript can yield re-compositions of segments grouping the smaller structural units—its bibliographic code, pace McGann—to help us unlock the secrets of genesis.  

Except for the actual text, all of the material evidence is detailed and organized in a series of codicological tables below.[^13] All of the rows in the tables, except for the headers, represent a page. These are organized from top to bottom in the order in which they are found today in Saint-Dié des Vosges—what we could call for brevity's sake, *the Saint-Dié witness*. This order also corresponds to the pagination scheme labeled `Page`. 

The first table ([table a]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-a/)), lists the support materials used for the typescript. The witness as we find it is composed of 108 loose sheets, including the title page. I recognize a total of four (or five, depending on how you look at it) different types of paper. I distinguish these under the heading `Paper` as `atemoya`, `atemoya+`, `batata`, `coco` and `durian`. The most common type is `atemoya`, thin, of a yellowing white hue (21.6 x 28 cm). Those pages marked `atemoya+` have sheets of the same material as `atemoya`, except they are a few milimeters larger lengthwise. `batata` and `coco` belong to two self-contained segments in Act 1. batata is thin and pink (21.6 x 27.8 cm). The twenty leaves made of this paper are only found towards the beginning of the play as it stands now. `coco` follows `batata` in the current pagination, and is thin and white with a light blue tint (21 x 27 cm). Last, but not least, `durian` seems to have been introduced at a late stage of composition, and mostly appears in revisions made to Act 2. This paper is thick white and also yellowing, at times with rough-hewn edges, indicating the leaves came from a larger sheet. (22.4 x 28 and 21.6 x 28 cm).

The document seems to be, for the larger part, a copy of a missing original, and traces of carbon paper are visible in a large number of pages. At least two kinds of carbon paper were used: blue and black. The traces of carbon paper residue in the typescript vary in intensity: at some points the paper is very dirty, at others very clean. None of the patterns align with other patterns we find in the pagination schemes, neither with the type of paper, nor with the type of revision instrument, which leads us to conclude that Césaire had a consistent supply of two types of carbon paper. Some pages are marked `orig`, for original, because we can't perceive any carbon residue on them—or at least without more scientific rigor. These pages mostly place towards the end, and indicate a late stage of the process.

The text was also revised using a variety of instruments. All of these are catalogued in [table b]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-b/) according to the pages in which they were used.

The witness has interesting features which push the boundaries of traditional codicology, and yet make fine additions to our catalogue of material evidence. These range from the regular, to the highly peculiar. Some of the regular features are listed in [table c]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-c/). For example, some pages end half-way through, usually marked with a large X drawn across the empty bottom space of the page. I flag these in the table as `Half Pages`. These pages can sometimes give us clues about the insertion of a page in a previous sequence, and other times help us isolate blocks of innominate and itinerant text.

Starting on page 41, and intensifying after page 60 of the current pagination, the typist[^b2] tries to use as much of the blank real state on the paper as possible, sometimes schewing the line towards the end of the page, as the paper began to slip from the platen roller. Perhaps paper became scarcer during the later stages of composition due to the American blockade? Perhaps the household became more frugal? This marked difference in the use of paper is indicated in *table c* as `Max Use`.

{% include image.html
    img="fig-m.png"
    title="slanted text"
    caption="figure m | oh, well" %}

The last of the regular features is the uneven practice of underlining the speakers, marked with an x under the heading `Underline`. This pattern is consistently used on the pages composed using `batata`, then dissappears for a while, only to intensify during the composition of the middle pages on `atemoya` paper. This quirk may indicate two typists, or simply two coherent periods of composition. Further evidence suggests the latter, but we cannot rule out the former. 

The Saint-Dié witness also yields many unique material clues, some helpful, some odd. We still don't know the typewriter that was used, but some clues point in the direction of an answer. The type in page 52 and 62, for example, is slanted—as if the paper locating guide was missing, or simply ignored. On many of the pages where carbon paper was used, four evenly-spaced columns of residue are visible to the naked eye. What machine produced such effects? A Remington? A Japy? Further study might answer the question.

Other traces suggest working methods. On page 70, for example, traces of blue ink matching the corrections on page 69 suggest the pages were stacked in order when the revisions were made. The verso of page 71 is a reverse mirror image of the front of the page, suggesting the typist accidentally placed a second, black carbon paper facing the wrong way. This implies that at least 3 copies of that page were attempted using the sandwich method: the missing original, (with blue carbon paper behind), our First Copy (with the flipped black carbon paper behind), and a missing third. 

Some traces, alas, remain nothing more than a tease to would-be genetic critics, like the words "*notions de base*" in all caps and underlined, in the back of page 75.[^b4] 

## the shuffle

We are now ready to retreive the main key: pagination. In total, we can count ten different pagination schemes spread throughout the typescript. The pagination schemes are catalogued in [table d]({{site.baseurl}}/fragiles/table-d/). The schemes are numerated using a variety of writing tools at the top of the pages. Some pages have several sets of numbers on them. Except for the library’s numeration, all numerations seem to come from Césaire’s hand. The last numeration added by Césaire determines the actual order of the pages as we find them today (`Page` in *tables a-d*)[^14]. This numeration will provide our canonical reference and will be indicated by a page number in parentheses.[^15] The page sequence established by `Page` is reinforced by the added pagination of a Saint-Dié des Vosges librarian, which I assume to be Albert Ronsin, who received the witness from Claire Goll, after Yvan's death[^b3]. I’ve divided the rest of the numbering into two groups, early and late. The late paginations (`P6-P8`) begin when `P6` introduces a continuous numeration that encompasses and organizes most of the text as we find it now, going from `P6.1` to `P6.103`. The early ones (`P1-P5`) mark a period of reorientation and experiment, where whole sections will change relative position or be heavily revised. The different pagination numbers also provide us with the principal criteria for re-organizing the text into smaller blocks to help us orient our genetic analysis of the text.


{% include image.html
    img="fig-n.jpg"
    title="paginations p1, page and p9"
    caption="figure n | from top left to top right: p1, page, p9" %}


In order to best understand the process by which we arrived at the current pagination, we can reverse-engineer the pagination schemes. The results of the reconstruction are visualized in the shape of a table in *figure p* below, starting in chronological order from left to right. As in *table d*, the rows in figure p represent individual pages. In this case though, the order of the pages from top to bottom is relative, in the sense that the numbering system found on the farthest left column stands for different orders at different periods of time. Each of the colored columns in *figure p* represents the state of the text at different stages of development, extending from left to right from the earliest pagination (`P1`) to the final pagination (`Page`). For example, under the colored column next to the column labeled `P1`, the colored cells represent only a total of 18 pages. In my estimate, these pages were the first 18 to be written. All other cells in this column are therefore empty. The page numbers belonging to each stage are written immediately to the left of the colored columns. The numbers in gray correspond to either missing pages (ex. `P1.3` and `P1.4`) or page numbers marked in an earlier pagination scheme, which are assumed to be inherited for the current pagination scheme. Missing pages are devoid of color. The rationale follows the results.

The most likely candidate for the title of earliest extant segment in the typescript corresponds to the 18 pages marked `P1` (23-40), all using `coco` paper.[^17] The handwriting used for this pagination is different from Césaire's usual handwriting, and it can be found on the top left of its pages, very close to the corner. The pagination comprises a segment of 18 pages marked from 1 to 20, with pages 3 and 4 missing. To reiterate, the pagination is indicated on the table by the black numbers under the `P1` column. The segment begins without the heading “*Acte*” written at the top of page 1, as all other pages marked 1 do in the other numeration schemes. At this early stage, we have no evidence that Césaire envisioned his work in progress as a three-act drama—but despite his fib to Beloux, the early pages do suggest Césaire was writing a play meant for the stage. `coco`, the thin white paper, is also not present in any other pagination scheme. Only in one other case does a specific kind of paper correspond to a specific pagination scheme: `batata` and `P2`.

Three features of the content also suggest that `P1` was the earliest segment: a) Page 1 begins with stage directions that set the scene “*à Saint-Domingue*,” announcing the general setting for Act 1 and Act 2; b) The episodes in the segment roughly align with the early period of the Haitian Revolution; and c) The segment contains the least amount of poetic interventions by Toussaint, the chorus and/or the reciters of all the drama, providing the most straightforward episodes of the whole. If indeed `P1` was the first batch composed, this last feature suggests that the original orientation of the drama leaned towards a popular stage. Even if it remains to be seen whether the completed text is suitable for the stage or not, this segment would certainly be the most accessible to the general public.

Next in the genetic order we have `P2`. All the pages with `P1` numbers (23-40) were shifted down in the overall structure of the text by the insertion of those pages marked with pagination `P2`. The strongest evidence comes from the fact that `P2` is only one page out of step with the final sequence. As opposed to the pages of `P1`, the pages of `P2` remained approximately where its own numeration indicated they should be. A bit of logic and observation helps here. If we were to claim that `P2` was composed prior to `P1`, then we would have to conclude that `P1` was not meant to be the beginning of Act 1. The evidence does not support this conclusion. The reader will remember that `P1` begins with the number 1, and at no point until `P6` does this change. Why would Césaire begin at number 1 what will be page 23 if he had meant for this new text to be a continuation of `P2`? 

One possible response is that he wrote both in tandem, undecided about their relationship to each other. This perhaps would explain the use of different paper stacks. Another that `P1` was written as an alternative beginning to `P2`. After all, both retain their low numbers until `P6`. Yet another is that `P1` was meant to be the beginning of a putative Act 2. The problem with these hypotheses is that the elements of the narrative within `P1`, mentioned above, do not support them. A much simpler explanation is that `P2` was written after `P1`. Furthermore, as we shall see below when we take a closer look at the content of `P2`, its historical action followed at one point the historical action of `P1`, before falling prey to the mighty pencil.

We cannot prove with empirical certainty that the `P2` pages were composed before any of the other segments, but the order of composition in *figure p* remains likely. Present in Act 1 only, the numbers of `P2` were written in pencil on the top-left corner, going sequentially and uninterrupted from 3 to 23 (2-22).[^18] Just as in `P1`, the pages of `P2` correspond to one unique type of paper. In this case, the paper is the unapologetic pink `batata`. The next pagination in the series, `P3`, provides further reason to believe that `P2` should come second in the series. The numbers of `P3` were typewritten on the top-left corner of the page. This pagination can be found exclusively in segments belonging to Act 2 and Act 3. If `P2` was written after `P3`, I don’t see why it wouldn’t have followed suit and marked its pagination in type as well. It seems probable that the pages of `P2` were written as those of `P1`, before the structure started congealing, leaving the pagination blank during the typing, and adding it later in pencil, after the edifice started to take shape.

`P3` will eventually be replaced by `P4` and `P5`, with pagination now written on the top-right corner. Since we can be fairly certain all other paginations inhabiting the same pages as `P3` are posterior to it, we can be confident that `P5` and `P4`, which overlap for the most part with `P3`, mark a later stage of development in the structure of the text. Top-right pagination for `P2` would have aligned it more with this middle period. The case being the opposite, the top-left pagination groups it with the earlier stages. Since `P3` was also marked in the top-left corner, albeit with type, the empty corners of`P1` and `P2` could be filled in on the same spot as the type. 

The extant `P3` pages begin at `P3.3`(43), with `P3.1` and `P3.2` for Act 2 missing, and in act 3 with `P3.2`(74). This numeration by act will soon be replaced by continuous pagination. In that sense `P3` marks the moment when we know with certainty that the text takes the current three-act structure.

Regardless of the placement of the pagination, if `P2` was written after `P3`, (still a possibility) this means that it was not written with a clear sense of where it belonged, even after the overall structure was becoming clear to Césaire. It would also entail that Césaire started using `atemoya` to compose `P3`, then switched to `P2` to compose this strange section without a home, to return to `atemoya` for `P4` and `P5`, leaving pink paper behind. This seems unlikely. Putting aside the lingering suspicion that Suzanne was at the typewriter, if Aimée was indeed using different paper types to divide possible segments/acts, why does Act 2 and 3 use mostly the same paper? The more reasonable conclusion is that the pages of `P2` were written before the composition of Act 2 and Act 3, and therefore before `P3`, `P4` and `P5`.

Thus far, while arguing for the position of `P2` in the sequence, we managed to place `P3`, `P4` and `P5` as well. As we approach `P6`—when Césaire unites all acts under one sequential numeration for the first time—we should note that all three acts follow a different genetic pattern ([figure p](#figure-p)). Act 1 and Act 3 are different from each other in that the first joined two blocks of text sequentially, like cutting a deck of cards, while the last intercalated text in the crevices of an earlier structure, like shuffling it. Act 2 evidences a much more complex genetic process. While Act 1 and Act 3 attain their stability soon enough, after `P6` the middle act continued to be reworked, prompting changes in what was clearly meant to be a final sequence. Notwithstanding, by the time we arrive at `P6`, the text has clearly achieved a structural landmark.

Although the changes to Act 2 could be considered minor in relation to the whole text, they are substantial relative to Act 2 itself. As you can see from *[figure p](#figure-p)*, the changes after `P6` comprise about 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the final text of Act 2. Several of these changes are also attempts at reframing the act. Starting with `P6.68`, and following with `P8.41-41’’’` we see an effort to change the way the act begins and ends.

Determining which came first, `P7` or `P8`, has not proved to be an easy task. Each of the segments was revised with a different (and rare) writing instrument, `P7` with red pencil, and `P8` with a dark pen. However, they both use the same kind of paper that comes into play after `P6`, `durian`. Moreover, while both have blocks of pages that relocate before the final organization, the transpositions of the former take place in the middle of the text, while the transpositions of the latter take place around the frame, making it difficult for us to determine their relative order of composition.  

Complicating us further, the `P8.41'-41'''` includes characters not present in the rest of the drama (Les bonnes gens, Déterreurs des pierres, ), and `P8.41` and `P7.47` are all too common poetic exchanges between the Reciters and Toussaint, making both sets uniquely portable. All of these, may have been written without a clear resting place in mind, except for `P8.41` which has the words "*Acte III*" typed at the top. `P8.41` is now, of course, the first page of Act 2. The exeption to this mobility are both `P7.48` and `P7.56-57`, which fall under the episode of "*des parlementaires*."   In the end we don't need to decide either way, and may even be justified in considering `P7` and `P8` as one single stage of composition at a moment when Césaire was ambivalent about framing the acts, and the middle thrust of Act 2.

Finally, the `Page` pagination adopts most of the numbering of `P6`, with some from `P7` and `P8`. The process continuously shifts the overall numeration down to accommodate all extra pages added after `P6`, right up until the last moment, when the transposition of `P8.41-41’’’` to the end of Act 2 tilts the sequence up a bit. The final sequence in `Page` is how the witness is ordered in a folder at the Fonds Claire et Yvan Goll near the German border today.

After [Bruce Holsinger](https://twitter.com/bruceholsinger) trended the hashtag [#thanksfortyping](http://www.npr.org/2017/03/30/521931310/-thanksfortyping-spotlights-unnamed-women-in-literary-acknowledgements) on Twitter, though, the lingering suspicion that Suzanne Césaire is our mysterious typist has recently flared up. I put $5 on it.

[^5]: This explains in part Césaire's article on Peguy and selections from his poetry in the first issue of *Tropiques*. In the article, Césaire defended Peguy for his nationalist love of the peasantry. Because Peguy had been appropriated by the Petainistes, Césaire could maneuver a message of Martinican particularity using him as a stand-in for a nationalism rooted on the peasantry. Let us not forget that it was Peguy who said "*Je ne veux pas que l'autre soit le même, je veux que l'autre soit autre. C'est à Babel qu'était la confusion, dit Dieu, cette fois que l'homme voulut faire le malin*" (*Œuvres poétiques complètes*. Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 60. Paris: Gallimard, 1941.) These words echo Césaire's own anti-assimilationism in the first issue of *l'Etudiant noir*: "Jeunesse Noire, il est un poil qui vous empêche d'agir : c'est l'Identique, et c'est vous qui le portez." This reading is, of course, complicated by the fact that Césaire had already praised Peguy for his "heroïsme" in another article published in Paris in 1939 (“Le Message De Charles Péguy.” *LʼAction Surréaliste* 53 (1939): 2). That other article ends with the words, "à Suivre," which imply that the Tropiques article is the announced continuation. The point remains, that the different reasons for praising him fall on different audiences, and that in both cases a peculiar reading is possible.

[^7]: Traffic seems to stop altogether in 1942 when the US ships cut off all access to the island for several months as the Germans intensified their campaign. This explains in part a gap in the correspondence between Césaire and Breton from April 20, 1942 to January 10, 1943.

[^8]: My gratitude to René Henane for allowing me to consult his transcriptions of the correspondence and for his generous friendship.

[^9]: I owe a great debt of gratitude to his widow, Nadine Ronsin, who has taken over the role of curator of the Goll collection in her husband’s stead. She has welcomed me on two occasions to the peaceful small town in Lorraine —where town lore would have it, the name America was uttered for the first time in history—with the sort of hospitality that inspires the best in others. I also thank her colleagues at the Bibliothèque Municipaple de Saint-Dié des Vosges for providing a comfortable work space and a pleasant atmosphere for the days of arduous scanning and research.

[^10]: We learn from the letters that “Un grand poète noir” was written at the behest of Goll as a possible introduction to the *Cahier d’un retour au pays natal*, by a somewhat unwilling Breton, who didn’t consider *Hemisphères* to be the appropriate vehicle for such a text. This short tribute to Césaire will go on to have a life of its own in several other publications since, most notably as the introduction of the Brentano’s edition of *Cahier d’un retour au pays natal* and as a chapter in Breton’s *Martinique, Charmeuse de serpents*.

[^11]: This dual-language edition was finally published three years later in 1947 by Brentano’s in New York.

[^12]: This statement remains true in so far as we have not yet recovered his thesis on Black Southern writers in the United States, and can only speculate how much effort he put into it. Not much would be my guess.

[^14]: As we will see shortly, `Page` inherits most of `P8` until page 55. What I am calling `Page` is a combination of page numbers from `P6`, a few pages of `P7` and `P8`, and page numbers written at the last stage of pagination. In Table A, in the column named `Page`, the page numbers which are inherited are written in gray in order to distinguish them from those written at the time when the text received its final organization.

[^15]: Other numbering systems will be indicated by `pagination.page`. Sometimes the `Page` number will follow in parenthesis when appropriate. Ex. `P6.55` (56) is the same as ‘the page with the number 55 in the number set labeled `P6`, and the page with the number 56 in the set labeled `Page`.’

[^17]: As I indicated before, the numbers in parentheses represent the `Page` pagination. In this case, these pages were originally numbered 1, 2…20. That would be the `P1` numbers. In the final ordering they became 23, 24…40. This would be the `Page` numbers.

[^18]: We assume the existence at some point of `P2.1` and `P2.2`, but these have disappeared without a trace.
