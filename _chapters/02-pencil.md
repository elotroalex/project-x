## speculative stages

[Big Bang Data](http://www.cccb.org/en/exhibitions/file/big-bang-data/45167) moved from Barcelona to Singapore's ArtScience Museum in 2016. Everything about the exhibit was supposed to make you feel small, and Safdie's brobdingnagean lotus in Marina Bay Sands was just the venue. After the first few hallways insisted on the overwhelming material scope of our online worlds, we arrived at a welcomed bench to relax over a short film on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/). A few minutes into the reel, though, Brewster Kahle's dream of "universal access to all knowledge" surfaced again, seaside of ultra-condensed capital, to unsettle any rest we hoped for—all knowledge, all access, all the time. 

Here I was a few words ago worrying about what pages in an obscure manuscript by Aimé Césaire have a few traces of blue carbon paper residue on them, and the Internet Archive wants to version it all. They go about their dreams with a semi-regular periodicity akin to a temperamental farmer's almanac, and they do so with a certain degree of excellence that merits praise and gratitude. They are not alone, of course. Since Google began dreaming in page caches and scanned books, we've only seen the lust for versions grow stronger, even versioning ourselves with FitBits and what nots. 

In culture work, we have recently taken to GitHub and git as sanity check and safeguard against collective loss—first as software, next as text, all distributed. Provided that Github, or a forward migration survives, anyone interested in reconstructing my own deviations in stages would have a much easier time than we can ever hope for Césaire or any number of writers. As I write these paragraphs on a plain text editor, every now and then, when I can name the changes I've made, I switch to the command line and `git add`, `commit` and `push` to Github, where the new version becomes accessible to the public, or at least that segment of the public that feels comfortable navigating the platform and has moderate bandwidth. Let me do so now that I've made some revisions I can name, and I quote:

~~~
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "edited paragraphs on version lust"
$ git push origin master
~~~

If you ever want to revisit the work at this stage, you can always visit or revert to commit number <a href="https://github.com/elotroalex/project-x/commit/3c2b9f0b4f8092eb3e3f62ef5fa58ab71206031f" style="overflow-wrap: break-word; word-wrap: break-word;">3c2b9f0b4f8092eb3e3f62ef5fa58ab71206031f</a>.[^b2] The size of that checksum hash—a unique name for a unique state of the text—makes me feel no less insignificant than a big data bang or a concrete lotus flower visible from the sky, and yet I persist in these granular versions with the same dignity as Marquez' *coronel* and his rooster. 

The lie, of course, is that you can see all past versions of this work on Github. Not all changes I make to this text make it to Github. Every time I add or delete characters in my text editor git recognizes these changes as modifications, but it won't record them at all into its data store unless I first indicate at what point and which files or changes I want to "stage" and subsequently commit to the index. The `add` command is there precisely to stage these files or changes before the index. In the case above, the dot after the `git add` command tells git to stage all modifications in my working directory, but I could've chosen to stage only selected files, or even parts of that file using the `--patch` command. This strange middle ground between a modification and the record of that modification sets apart git from a typescript and other versioning systems, and makes it all the more seductive because it gives an extra layer of control over what versions we make available to the index.

The git stage—or staging area—marks the opposite pole of our most important performance stages along the lines of a *stare decisis*. While the former marks the timid decision of one writer to present chosen variations to the machine, the latter presents before us a set of certain collective commitments that bless it with Significance. This spectrum is echoed in the roots of the word. By the time the medieval inheritors of Latin go from the vulgar *staticum*, a place to stand, a sojourn, to Middle French *estage*, the stage comes to have both modern meanings relevant to us: a dwelling in a series and a platform for a performance, never shedding the slip between each other—*estar, no ser.* 

The ruin of versions haunts the textual critic, erasures and additions, all crumbling under eternal sunshine; and yet we persist, not because we desire to build a library for Troglodytes in a City of Immortals; nor to preempt all possible meanings—meaning is cheap in New York, and even a crushed Skittle on Broadway can deliver. We persist because we seek the halo of Significance. The textual critic, the curator, and a few other memorists, fated to seize hold of any of these stages and repeat them in moments of historical need, dwells in a spooky continuum, where the past is always a feature of the future. While we may be excused to dedicate countless pages to technical matters, faustidious to a fault, our calling is to create the conditions for a future staging of the past and its audience, and to do so through a careful oscillation between the mechanisms of the past and those of our time.[^b4]

A revised typescript, like git, serves as a versioning system with a different set of hashes, and like any other versioned set we can find within alternative futures and renewed significance. Jerome McGann's recognition of a "linguistic" and a "bibliographic code" as the condition of all text can help illuminate the way here.[^b3] The linguistic code can be understood as the set of allographs in a document (letters, words, accidentals, etc.); the bibliographic code as the set of non-linguistic documentary features (font, layout, paper texture, brightness, etc.). Both are beholden to infrastructures (libraries, sellers, browsers, law, etc.) and specific historical demands (prestige, freedom, epistemology, etc.). Always fused, they guide our sense-making, and we only come to know the meaning of either through the other, as an autopoetic mystery, with or without a numen. And they both matter—could you, for example, imagine the 20th Century if *The Communist Manifesto* had been originally printed in Comic Sans, or Comic Sans without its absence from 20th Century editions of *The Communist Manifesto*?

The pagination schemes of the Sain-Dié witness allowed us in chapter one to outline a rough, geometric schema for the stages of composition of "...et les chiens se taisaient" ([figure p]({{site.baseurl}}/images/fig-p-full.png)). Guided by its intimate bibliographic code, catalogued in chapter one in *tables a-d*, we could take it a step further and make the geometric abstractions textual by re-staging our material observations as fragmentary editions, somewhere between a quote and the edition of a work, and hopefully fair in their transformative use. Re-made into its speculative stages, we will be better able to take into account the shifting terrain of the drama to refine our genetic gambit. We cannot do so without a certain degree of awe, presenting the past through texts that never existed until now, bound to the sample reality of a text that has existed for several decades—a conjectural and forensic praxis informed by an afro-futurist ethic.

The bind between speculative computing and archival history is not free from suspicion, though. In "Notes towards a Deformed Humanities,"[^b10] textual alchemist Mark Sample questions the return in an attempt to substract the *performance* from McGann and Samuel's *deformance*[^b9]:

> I don’t want to put Humpy Dumpty <span style="font-style:normal;">[sic]</span> back together.
>
> Let him lie there, a cracked shell oozing yolk. He is broken. And he is beautiful. The smell, the colors, the flow, the texture, the mess. All of it, it is unavailable until we break things. And let’s not soften our critical blow by calling it deformance. Name it what it is, a deformation. <span style="font-style:normal;">(Sample)</span>

Sample's effort to give equal significance to a "deformation" without a post-publication return to the source, pushes back—*avant ma lettre*—against all attempts to remake stages of the past in order to reconstruct a genesis—with or without computation. I share much ethos with Mark Sample—an appreciation for breaking and the broken, the hospitality of sharing, the enchantment of oulipean approaches, the err on the side of work over thinking, and the panache—but the temporalities in the above effort give me pause. While I do want the speculative stages of the typescript to stand on their own two feet, I also don't want to foreclose your visit to Saint-Dié des Vosges. "The deformed work is the end, not the means to the end," rebutts Sample. He is right, of course, in the way that we are right in recommending our own *inventio*, but our sources bring bills with them—beyond copyright law—for a debt we cannot pay, nor ignore. Though I am convinced of the latent capacity of a remix to achieve escape velocity—a history of cultural appropriation confirms it—I am not so convinced we should bar our worthy returns... at least not here, not now. 

Many of us suspect that Humpty Dumpty has always been broken, and the point has always been to repair it. In a materialist sense, the past is not mine, or a mine for the extraction of linguistic resources, but the dwelling for our future significance—less Marinetti's *futurism*, and more Reed's *necromancy* in Alondra Nelson's reading of PaPa LaBas' "jes grew",[^b11]

> Rather than a "Western" image of the future that is increasingly detached from the past or, equally problematic, a future-primitive perspective that fantasizes an uncomplicated return to ancient culture, LaBas foresees the distillation of African diasporic experience, rooted in the past but not weighed down by it, contiguous yet continually transformed.(6)

The conjectural exercise in this chapter is also indebted to Kari Kraus, who is careful to keep past-future together in her work—albeit in the service of different *santos* than mine—and whose efforts to reunite a "family of subjunctive practices"[^b5] around speculative design amount to a medicine kit for a bevy of modern ills: scientifism and its obverse, the fear of science; subservient fidelity to scholarly protocols; premature dismissal of algorithms; arrested imaginaries, etc. In "Conjectural Criticism: Computing Past and Future Texts,"[^b6] Kraus makes a convincing argument that "conjectural criticism (the reconstruction of literary texts) can be profitably understood as a sub-domain of Ramsay's algorithmic criticism (rule-governed manipulation of literary texts),"(3) and provides an incisive definition of conjecture in the service of textual criticism:

> Conjecture is *allographic inference to past or future values of the sign*. Allographic is a semiotic term given currency by the analytic philosopher Nelson Goodman in his seminal <span style="font-style:normal;">Languages of Art</span> and refers to those media that resolve into discrete, abstract units of information—into what might be more loosely called digital units—that can be systematically copied, transmitted, added to, subtracted from, transposed, substituted, and otherwise manipulated. <span style="font-style:normal;">(16)</span>

Kraus leaves me some room to play in her diagnosis of the dearth of conjecture in contemporary textual scholarship and archival practices. For Kraus, the lack comes from the relatively recent "wealth of scholarship promoting the text's bibliographic or iconic codes," generously clarifying that "despite the virtues of such visual approaches to textuality (and there are many), conjectural criticism has been hamstrung by their success." I would diagnose the lack of conjecture otherwise as a collective clutching of pearls—android barbarians at the door—and place bibliography as a doorstop for good measure. Just like Eureka moments can "open the floodgates" for Kraus—mechanical or otherwise—an autographic textuality that is allowed to, indeed must return unimpeached from allography can only increase the bounty. Unable to escape embodiment, allographs cannot survive a repetition without a new bibliographic code, and that new code can be (must be if the computer is a machine)  determined by allographic processes[^b7]—allowing us in turn to remain faithful to Kraus' *exhortatio*, without sacrificing our commitment to bibliographic past-futures.

The radical alternative, to reduce allographic transactions to the linguistic code, makes me nervous. I hear in that move the unintended echoes of a literary theory inatentive to the means of production of its own knowledge, the premature deaccession of "copies" from libraries, and the legal alibis of "content" cartels incapable of reading. Quite the conundrum, since I truly appreciate the wonders of our distant readings and oulipean provocations. Perhaps the way forward is a praxis where the butterfly and the pupa are never long apart from each other on the stage. Faced with an archival past choked by colonial epistemologies and cruel capital flows, wouldn't this pledge to past-future bibliography, *cum* infrastructure critique, help us all the better device repairs that can answer to our emancipatory demands? *Al freír de los huevos lo verá.*

## revolution rising

To recapitulate, in order to understand the transformation of the typescript from a straightforward historical drama to the layered text we find in Saint-Dié, and as an example of what we may gain from speculative stages, I want to restage the genesis of "...et les chiens se taisaient" through the algorithmic manipulation of its bibliographic cues and slow read the output. 

In our case, we can define a speculative stage as *the repetition of a given historical document's allographs determined by the computation of one or more of its discrete bibliographic features for the purpose of understanding its genesis*. This definition is leery of purely random recreations of the text. Even if we spun the pages solely according to the features marked in *tables a-d*, we would have 2354! ways of doing it, which makes Google's calculator shrug its shoulders and spit out "infinity." Notwithstanding serendipity, for the idea of a speculative stage to provide us with a useful past, we must limit our re-creations to plausible or instructive states of the existing document. A speculative stage made up of only handwritten revisions, for example, would be useful as a genetic data mine, and a reconstruction of all the pages encompassed by a particular pagination as an edition.

If we gathered the pages of `P1`, and made an edition based on the original type *sans* revisions, we end up with a relatively coherent speculative stage. We can start there and call it "[Revolution Rising]({{site.baseurl}}/editions/sdw-revolution/)." This past-future text, presented here in bibliographic codes [determined by minimal computing](http://elotroalex.github.io/ed/), contains the largest number of historical references of the drama: names, locales and events which correspond more or less to the early period of the Haitian Revolution. 

The curtain opens on a plantation in Saint-Domingue. A few white girls play outside. The Chorus, a Reciter, and a Recitress (CRR) enter the stage to warn the girls of impending dangers: “*Rentrez chez-vous jeunes filles, il n’est plus temps de jouer, les orbites de la mort poussent des yeux fulgurants à travers le mica blême.*”[^21] The girls respond to that poetical warning in plain French: “*C’est une devinette?*”[^22] After two further, brief exchanges, the girls begin to mock the odd strangers: “*Hou, hou*.”[^23] The mother appears at the door and, sensing the true danger of the situation, she asks the girls to come inside. Thus begins the earliest form of the drama.

In the next scene, the Chorus, the Reciter, and the Recitress bury an imaginary body while reciting the words “*Adieu, Saint-Domingue*.” The mock burial sets the stage for the carnage that characterizes the drama. Combined with the preceding episode, these initial gestures set the Haitian Revolution as the main subject of the story. This frame is completely different from the one we get in all future versions. For example, as early as `P2`[^24] the frame changes to focus on the death of Toussaint (Le Rebelle in the published versions). In other words, though Toussaint was an important character from the beginning, the earliest conception of the work suggests a drama centered on the historical event proper.

Another notable feature of "Revolution Rising" is its theatricality. After the reciters bury the imaginary body of Saint Domingue, we have the following stage direction:

> *(A ce moment l’obscurité envahit la scène; des coups de feu; des cris discordants; puis le tapage s’apaise peu à peu; quand la lumière revient, le décor a changé: le camp des nègres au milieu d’une forêt. Chefs nègres et députés blancs en conférence).*[^25] (24)

The instructions are specific to a staged spectacle. Each of the lines refers to sound, lighting, or décor, with only one adjective thrown in the mix, “*discordants*.” Compare the sentence, for example, to a parallel passage towards the beginning of the first published version:

> *(Dans la barathre des épouvantements, vaste prison collective,  peuplée de nègres candidats à la folie et à la mort; jour trentième de la famine, de la torture et du délire).*[^26] (98)

The latter, by contrast, do not contain a single element that would facilitate staging in an actual theater, despite the dark appeal of the scene in the reader’s imagination. Even the line "*prison collective*" is wrested from the stage by the adjective "*vaste*." Although I am not interested at the moment in arguing that the typescript is suitable for the stage, something I believe can only be tested on an actual stage, it seems clear to me that "Revolution Rising" gravitates towards a theatrical representation. Other stage directions in our speculative stage support that conclusion, with a limited amount of (debatable) extra-theatrical elements found on the directions on `P1.15` (35) and the last page, `P1.20` (40).[^27]

"Revolution Rising" uses two kinds of narrative modes: either the story develops through the action and dialogue of the characters on stage, or it is narrated by the Chorus, Reciter and Recitress trio (CRR). We will shortly come back to the diegetic narrative, one of the keys to unraveling the transition from history to myth in the text. In the mimetic narrative, we count three large episodes. As the white delegates begin to lay their diplomatic traps, Toussaint invites them to address the black troupes directly. The crowds seem to waiver after the seductive pleas of the delegates to disarm them, but Toussaint sways them by signaling their devious intentions. Once persuaded of the righteousness of their cause, the crowds unleash their machetes and the refrain which will echo throughout the rest of the drama: “*Mort aux blancs*!” Death to the whites.[^28] The delegates are massacred, and the rebels descend on the rest of the white population with their sharp response.

After a brief CRR recitation, rife with ghoulish visions of the revolutionary bloodbath, the scene moves to an assembly of planters at Cap \[Français\] presided over by the governor. In their arrogance, the white planters continue to underestimate the situation. Blanchelande[^29], the governor, fails to bring them to their senses. On the streets, passersby echo the haughtiness of the assembly. Soon after, the tumult of the revolution bursts onto the scene. The episode continues with a mock-assembly of black rebels, or as the text has it “*une séance sinistre et bouffonne pleine d’emphase et de cruauté.*”[^30] The episode ends as another group of rebels follows a standard bearer into the assembly waving the head of the governor on a pike.

After another CRR recitation, the final, and rather brief, staged narrative brings us back to the beginning of "Revolution Rising", with the mother and the girls now running for cover. The scene quickly changes to a field of slaves who ‘sing their fatigue’ in call and response for two pages. The speculative stage ends with a CRR recitation, and what seems to be, at least on the surface, the most extra-theatrical stage direction of "Revolution Rising": a ship in distress invades the field of vision, and in the phosphorescent sea an inscription explodes. In a later addition, absent from "Revolution Rising," we learn that the inscription read: *République d’Haiti.* As we will shortly see, this cinematic technique fits a particular theatrical modality available in the 1940's.

I summarize these three episodes not only to help the reader enter this difficult francophone text through the most accessible door, but to emphasize a few important observations about the genesis of the text. The first point is that Toussaint is not the central figure initially, but rather one character amongst many in a dramatization of events of the Haitian Revolution. The second point is that these episodes are meant to suggest the first stages of the revolution: a committee negotiating for leaders to be set free at the expense of the rank and file, the assembly at Cap Français unaware of the gravity of the situation, the bloody scenes of rebellion when slavery still reigned supreme in Saint-Domingue—In brief, the most basic retelling of the early stages of the revolution.

Other details which barely catch our attention confirm that we are dealing with the early days of the revolution. During the assembly of planters, the governor warns that “*Toussaint et Boukmann ont constitués une armée*.”[^31] This places us around the year 1791.[^32] On `P1.2` [(24)](/data/sdw-data/P024.jpg), we notice that the lines delivered by the second French delegate have been marked for deletion with red ink. In the lines the delegate proposes freedom for the rebel leaders. At this point in the original, two missing pages follow, pages `P1.3` and `P1.4`. As the action returns on `P1.5` (25), Toussaint asks Dessalines[^33] to stand back (also erased with red ink later on). This suggests that the two missing pages carried details of the negotiations between the white delegates and other leaders besides Toussaint, Dessalines being the one who survives by name. The historical Jean Jacques Dessalines was involved in the revolution from the start, though not immediately as a leader, and his appearance here is consistent with the history of the early revolution. Leaving aside for now the historical incongruities which students of the revolution will immediately recognize in these dramatizations, these effaced figures further testify to Toussaint’s marginal role in this speculative stage.

Towards the end of "Revolution Rising", during the last recitation, the Reciter announces that Sonthonax has opened the prisons, armed the slaves, and opened the doors to several important cities. This refers no doubt to the most famous deed of the Civil Commissioner, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax, to declare an end to slavery in Saint Domingue under the pressure of revolutionary forces. This places the end of the segment around October 1793. In retrospect, "Revolution Rising" forms a non-Aristotelian[^34] dramatic unit which can be said to follow a chronological order consistent with the historical record.

Nothing within `P1` would place the action outside the span 1791-1793, except for one anachronism which deserves brief notice since it reinforces the notion that at this stage of its development the work is oriented towards the theatre. I am referring to the song “À la Martinique,” hummed by one of the voices on the street outside the assembly of planters on page `P1.13` (33) of the original[^35]:

> *A la Matinique, Matinique, Matinique \\
> c’est çà qui chic...*

This character is paying homage to the famous *café-concert* singer
Felix Mayol, who popularized the song in France at the beginning of the twentieth century. The complete lyrics tell the story of a black man from Martinique who falls in love with a white flower shop attendant and becomes a boxer to satisfy her demand for jewelry and pretty dresses. The song was originally composed in English by George M. Cohan, the “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” for an American minstrel show.[^36] Not surprisingly, the lyrics present several racist stereotypes of the time. What is more important to us is that Césaire makes a direct reference to Music-Hall, and an indirect reference to minstrelsy. How familiar this song was to Martinique audiences is difficult to ascertain, especially when we consider the song was already thirty years old by the time our text was produced. This is, nevertheless, a familiar theatrical gesture. Paired together with the slave song towards the end, the performance echoes and demands a stage.

The next theatrical detail that deserves attention is the odd stage direction on `P1.19`. The Recitress narrates: 300,000 rebels attack the city, white crowds jam the main gates, trying to reach the ships in the harbor. A stage direction interrupts the narration: “*A mesure qu’elle parle, tout cela se dessine sur l’écran*.”[^37] This stage direction will later be erased by pencil. While it lingered there, however, it opened up the text to an intermediation that hardly belongs in a closet drama.

The use of the screen to project static and moving images on the theater stage can be traced back to the ‘cinemagician’ Georges Méliès[^38] at the beginning of the century, but it is Erwin Piscator who will make it a prominent theatrical practice in 1920s Weimar Germany. Although several critics have pointed out the Brechtian inflections in Césaire’s theater,[^39] very little attention has been given to Brecht’s collaborator and friend Piscator, who developed a different conception of ‘Epic Theater’ from Brecht, one that depended on stage machinery, film projectors, large crowds on stage (*Sprechchöre*), and a political style marked by didacticism and documentary modes.

In the absence of documentary evidence, I find it difficult to ascertain whether Césaire knew the work of Piscator (or Brecht) during his years in Paris. Piscator remained in Paris to avoid Stalin’s Great Purge for the two years that Césaire was a student at the École Normale Superieure, but (to my knowledge) he does not seem to have staged or published while Césaire was there. Much more likely, Piscator’s innovations came to Césaire’s attention via Paul Claudel’s *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb*. Although the latter drama was not staged until 1953, the book was published by Gallimard during Césaire’s years in Paris, with two runs in 1933 (one with illustrations by Jean Charlot, the other *sans*) and a reprint in 1935.[^41] Claudel was so taken with Piscator’s experiments that he had asked him to collaborate on *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb*. That collaboration never took place, but the response of the one to the other remains evident.[^42] 

In a recent article, Pierre Laforgue connects *Tête d’or*, *Le Soulier de satin*, and to a lesser extent *Le Livre de Christophe Colomb* with *Et les chiens se taisaient*. His own reading connects Colomb and Le Rebelle through analogy: "*Il faut reconnaître que l’ambition du Rebelle et celle de Christophe Colomb présentent un certain nombre d’analogies.*"[^40] This reading, echoed in the title of the essay, "Césaire et Claudel: une cantate à deux voix." misses the essential antagonism between the two, evident in the typescript, but not exactly hidden in the published versions. 

Césaire’s reconstruction of Claudel’s own “*théâtre total*” seems over-determined: an evident overlap between the *dramatis personae*, early traces of similar techniques, and more importantly, perhaps, a dialectical negation of Columbus in *Chiens,* who will become the explicit nemesis of `P2`[^43]. The tension between these two texts deserves a longer treatment than we can supply in this study. For now, what should draw our attention is the use of the screen in Claudel’s drama. The screen is present from the beginning of his play “*au fond de la scène*,” [^44] arguably serving a dramatic, didactic, and choral role, in Brecht’s acceptation. Although Claudel invokes the screen more often than Césaire’s lone example, their functions overlap. Here is an example from Part I, scene X of *Le Livre*: “*Tout cela apparaît mélangé sur l’écran*” (46).[^45] 

Both Césaire and Claudel—using almost the same formula—project on a screen whose function is both mimetic and diegetic, and whose main trope is the χορός, here understood not as a separate role within the drama, but the corralling of all roles singing in unison. In other words, for Césaire and Claudel, the chorus sings *in chorus* with the screen. The difference, is that Césaire recuperates the screen away from Claudel, re-writing the ideology behind Luke 14:25-27 by two mechanisms: repopulating the screen with the revolution, and by shifting the fugitive birth of the nation from colonizer to colonized:

From Claudel…

> CHRISTOPHE COLOMB II, de même: Quitte ta mère! Abandonne-la! Quitte ta famille! Quitte, quitte ta mère! La Volonté de Dieu est ta patrie! Tout cela qui t'empêche de partir, tout cela est ton ennemi.

> CHRISTOPHE COLOMB I: Quitterai-je mon père et ma mère? Quitterai-je ma patrie? Tout cela apparaît mélangé sur l'écran.

…to Césaire:

> La récitante (dolente): 300.000 hommes, tribart brisé, se précipitent dans la ville et poussent des hurlements clabauds... Le port est couvert de blancs qui cherchent à gagner les bâtiments en râde... Ah, les chaloupes chavirent... (A mesure qu’elle parle, tout cela se dessine sur l’écran.)

By a circuitous route, this brings us back to the light blue ink addition in `P1`, when the words “*Republique d’Haïti*” become projected on the phosphorescent sea. Presumably written during the temporal shift that would accomodate `P2`, and before the pencil corrections that will excise most of the work’s theatricality, this stage direction elicits the phantasmagorical return of the earlier screen. The Piscatorean projection of letters on the stage wall, in Césaire become a site of mediation, where stagecraft starts to capitulate to the poetic stage.

As I pointed out above, the Chorus and the Reciters intrude between the dramatic episodes, establishing a rhythm of sorts between them and the action. As "Revolution Rising" begins, they engage with the girls on the stage, but besides this brief metalepsis, they remain outside of that action. Their words, nevertheless, are in constant dialogue with the events dramatized on stage. For the most part, these intrusions from CRR consist of narrative or commentary. Though they speak in a highly elliptical poetic idiom, CRR is clearly describing and referring to events which are either already depicted on stage or are related to it. In this sense, the role of CRR combined does not depart substantially from the *χορός* in classical Greek theater. The individuated role of the Reciter and the Recitress, though, cannot be easily reduced to the role of a dual *κορυφαῖος*, nor as a black avant-garde reformulation of the strophe and antistrophe. They function instead in the "jes grew" of afro-diasporic call and response formations. 

> And so I have tried to reconcile those two worlds, because that was what had to be done. On the other hand, I feel just as relaxed about claiming kinship with the African griot and the African epic as about claiming kinship with Rimbaud and Lautreamont—and through them with Sophocles and Aeschylus! (Melsan) 

While the global reference to *Prometheus Bound* has been widely cited, even by Césaire himself[^b12], our chorus goes beyond the role of the Chorus of Daughters of Oceanus—at least at this stage of the composition—before the promethean model subsumes the drama. As in Sophocles’ Theban plays instead, the Chorus of "Revolution Rising" prophesies the nation, and at this stage of development, the Reciter and the Recitress call and respond to each other beyond classic Greek tragedy.

Once the episode with the delegates begins, after the two missing pages and after Toussaint invites the delegates to address the crowds, the Reciters barge on the scene to foreshadow the response of the crowds and the bloodbath to come:

> *Déja le silence empoisonne chaque fibre\\
> Des gestes hiéroglyphes avalés à moitié signalent\\
> Les jachères et les semis de cadavres* (25).[^46]

After the crowds have raised their war cry and the episode with the
delegates ends, CRR takes over the narration of the event:

> Le récitant: Un coup de sifflet... Les nègres sortent des broussailles avec une grande clameur. Les coutelas s’abattent et se relèvent et s’abat­tent dans le moulinet de l’exaspération (29).[^47]

These two early examples signal an important difference between early and late stages of composition, perhaps the one with the most repercussions. The first example, which we could call proleptic, and the second, which we could call diegetic, both refer to the action on the stage, to an unfolding plot for which they are a doubling of sorts (in the same way that the ‘screen’ was a doubling of the Chorus). This crucial function of the Chorus will soon change in the published versions of the text, as all reference to historical events is eventually ellided and the plot reduced to the point of stasis. At this stage though, the principal theme of the Chorus remains the revolution itself, and most of its diegetic recitations describe the epic events that cannot be represented on a real stage, at least not one without vast resources—words as stage props. 

Before its own future revolution, the Chorus also brings this stage to a close in a neat frame, from the opening burial of Saint-Domingue, to the enthusiastic birth of Haïti, but not without the minor note of *La Récitante*:

> Froid cœur de la mort, la lagune a dégainé son poignard.

In the following, I use two pagination schemes and all revisions made to it to construct two speculative stages, which I will then use to further explore the erosion of the historical referent in the genesis of the text and the rise of Toussaint as the central figure of the drama.

I call "Toussaint King" the text paginated with the number set labeled `P2`, without revisions. This also means that we are to take the text without the pagination itself, and assume that the pages were meant to follow `P1`.[^48] To construct **Virtual Version C**, I want to take all the pages in `P2` together with the first page added during `P6` and all the revisions made on the combined text. In other words, pages 1-22 of MAIN in their current state. The first page, added by `P6`, was written to replace what was originally `P2` 1 and 2 (now missing), and conforms very well with the rest of `P2`. Together they form a coherent analytical whole.

At some point, "Toussaint King" was set during the middle period of the Haitian Revolution, with references to Toussaint’s takeover of the Spanish part of the island, the defeat of the British forces, and an enactment of Toussaint’s capture. From an historical point of view, this is the most confused and confusing segment. In a later revision, all references to the middle-to-late period of the Haitian Revolution will be erased, and with a few masterful strokes, Césaire will bring the action to the early period of the French Revolution, the temporal setting of **Virtual Version C**.

If we take "Toussaint King" by itself, the action takes place sometime during Toussaint’s campaign in the Eastern part of the  island (1801):

> *Le choeur: Mon oeil se dore de visions souveraines..... Toussaint\\
> fait son entrée solennelle à Santo Domingo.....Le cavido\\
> lui remet les clefs de la ville*.[^49] (11)

 ven though they are framed as a vision, while the action remains solidly within a coherent temporal framework, these lines can be interpreted as the sort of typical *pragmatographia* found in **Virtual Version A**. The fictional timeline will soon change, and with it the rhetorical and poetic function of similar lines. In the meantime, we can already hear the potential for disassociating the action on the stage from the pseudo-historical narrative built into the diegetic function of the chorus in **Virtual Version A**. Once you remove the mimetic action on the stage that authorizes and gives meaning to them, lines such as these transform into a peculiar form of detached *ecphrasis*; soon enough, when the geographical and historical references disappear as well, these ostensive lines end up being removed completely or disfigured to refer to a vague archetypal history of the African diaspora and colonialism. My next chapter explores this phenomenon in the context of Césaire's international audiences.

At some undetermined late moment in the genesis of the typescript, the temporal progression of "Toussaint King" undergoes a radical shift. On the first page of `P6`, the type sets the scene geographically, “*La scène est à Saint Domingue*.” Césaire will eventually add “*à l’epoque de la Révolution française*”[^50] by hand next to it. In order to make the rest of the text conform to this new temporal reorientation, Césaire will make use of his pencil. The first such revision comes on `P6` 2 (2),

> *Le Chœur: Hurrah. Les Anglais sont perdus... Nos batteries d’approche\\
> balayent leurs remparts; nos batteries de brèche sont intallées...\\
> Saint-Marc craque... comme un vaisseau pourri...*[^51]

The rest of the pencil revisions will continue in the same spirit. On `P2` 14 (15), at the end of `P2`, the last line changes two times, making things even more complicated: “... *La Grande Révolution de Saint Domingue ~~continue~~ ~~a commencé .~~vient de commencer*” (22). At one point, the revolution continued, at another it had begun, and finally it had *just* begun.

To accommodate this recasting, many internal changes had to be made, most notably, the grammatical tense, which changes in several places from *passé composé* to *futur simple*: 

> *Toussaint: ~~J’avais amené~~ ^j’amenerai^ ce pays à la connaissancede\\
> lui-même,\\
> je familiaris~~é~~ ^erai^ cette terre avec ses démons secrets\\
> ~~allumé~~ ^j’allumerai^ aux cratères d’hélodermes et de cymbales\\
> les symphonies d’un enfer inconnu, splendide\\
> parasité de nostalgies hautaines...*[^52] (14)

We should note in passing that this can be used as further reason that `P2` was written after `P1`. The tense is adapting to the temporal model established by `P1`. In the first version of `P2`, the action follows `P1`, therefore the past tense is appropriate. As the timeframe moves to the French Revolution, the tense appropriately changes to the future. The passage refers, of course, to Toussaint’s past or future involvement in the Haitian Revolution. Several other changes will confirm this temporal reorientation, with the strange consequence that the narrations of CRR become *proleptic*, or as I have no reservations calling them, prophetic.

The most salient aspect of "Toussaint King" is perhaps the introduction of Toussaint Louverture as a central character. This speculative stage unfolds in four distinct episodes. We do not know exactly what the first two pages of `P2` contained. When the action resumes on `P2` 3 (2), the Reciter and Toussaint have the stage.

The Reciter begins with a trope, prevalent throughout the drama, that I would like to call for now —with T.S. Eliot’s permission— *the revolutionary correlative*: a poetic vision of violent/revolutionary phenomena, drawing its vehicles from nature. It is safe to say that these tropes characterize a large part of the poetry of CRR and Toussaint, and we will have more to say about them later on. Here is the example that opens `P2`:

> *En marge des marées sautillantes, je marche sur l’eau des printemps\\
> tournants ; j’aperçois très haut mes yeux de sentinelle. L’insomnie à\\
> toute épreuve grandit comme une désobéissance le long des tempes\\
> libres de la femme à l’emphore, verseau, verseau tempête de germes,\\
> bouilloire*.[^53] (2)

Toussaint Louverture trails these lines by making himself the locus of the violence, in a poetic sequence where he becomes intertwined with the landscape around him. On the next page, the scene is grounded roughly at the moment when the city of Saint-Marc surrenders, and the Reciter announces the arrival of the messenger of the king[^54] who would have a word with Toussaint.

In the next episode, Toussaint encounters three “*voix tentatrices*”[^55] who offer him riches and titles, in a scene reminiscent of the temptation of Christ, but more to the point, the temptations of Job. The theme of temptation will become the dominant structuring feature of all published versions of the text, with other lures confronting the Rebel. Already in the typescript we have several such encounters, the delegates of `P1` being the first. There is much to be said about this particular episode in `P2` where the would-be devils comment on the seductiveness of (their) language. In terms of the history of the text, the scene is important because it will reframe/reinforce the scene with the delegates of `P1`, as a scene of seduction. Furthermore, this scene sets up a struggle between the ‘beautiful’ words of deceit and the avowedly ‘truthful’ poetry of Toussaint. Once this struggle is in place, it becomes possible to read the whole drama as a battle for words themselves.

Following the temptation, Toussaint and CRR will engage in a series of long exchanges over freedom, truth, revolution, sight, and a series of other dominant themes. The result of this long exchange is that we start moving away from any purported historical action to a poetic recasting of the hero as the center of the revolution. CRR declares Toussaint a king, and in the same breath, CRR predicts his death. Toussaint accepts his fate and vows to die “naked.” Just as he laments that his message might fall on deaf ears, he meditates on the reverberation of radical action. This is also the episode where Toussaint names his enemy as “Colomb” and addresses him in lines of exquisite anguish.

In the final episode Toussaint confronts the crowds. They arrive on the stage ready to burn Toussaint. Rabble-rousers attempt to convince them that Toussaint is putting their lives in danger (yet another temptation), but Toussaint is able to sway them to the fight at hand by harshly scolding them for their cowardice. At the end of the episode the revolution continues, or is about to begin, or has just begun, but it is no longer the central focus of the play. The internal struggle of Toussaint the hero has taken over, and with this twist, historicity (and chronology) begin to erode.

## Virtual Version D: The concise drama.

I would like to end my analysis with one more speculative stage. It goes without saying that many other constructions can help refine our genetic analysis of the typescript. In fact, by ending our analysis of speculative stages here, we are ending it in the middle of the process that produced the typescript as we know it. I encourage the future student of the text, using the tools and precedents that I have laid out, to generate their own intermediary steps and perhaps correct or offer an alternative to my narrative.

Let us define **Virtual Version D** as those pages organized around and up to `P5` (including `P1`, **B**, `P3` and **C**) and excluding the extra-typographical revisions. To construct **Virtual Version D** we will also assume that those pages marked `P2` have not received their pagination yet, and follow the pages marked with `P1`. This effectively organizes the action in **Virtual Version D** chronologically, starting with the early days of the Haitian Revolution, moving on to the defeat of the English, and ending with Toussaint’s death in the Jura mountains.

Two features stand out in **Virtual Version D**: a) Four sections all roughly about 20-26 pages long (`P1` and **B** are considered here different sections). This contrasts with the three acts of the final version of the typescript, averaging 35 pages an act; b) and following from (a), **Virtual Version D** is a coherent, albeit shorter, drama. In order not to repeat myself unnecessarily, I will just focus on Act 2 and Act 3 since we have studied in some detail the substance of Act 1 (**speculative stages A** and **B**).

Here is a schematic view of the plot of Act 2 and *III* in **Virtual Version D** divided by episodes:

I. Act 2 (Saint Domingue)

a. A parade of officials and clergy praise Toussaint. The latter responds with disdain and turns the crowds against the hypocritical elites (42-46).
b. A group of white passersby complain about being ruled by a black general (48-50).
c. Toussaint expresses his dissatisfaction to CRR, who try to reassure him of his accomplishments (51-53).
d. White armies debark, leading to a new stage of the revolution: After a failed meeting with ‘Parliamentarians’, a new confrontation begins between the black armies and what is implied to be the armies of Napoleon (58, 60-61).
e. Toussaint’s troupes are forced to retreat to the bush to engage in guerilla warfare (62-63).
f. Over a scorched land, Toussaint sings of doubt while CRR sings the devastation (64-66).
g. The *Acte* ends with an encounter between Toussaint and a set of underground and celestial voices prophesying Toussaint’s imprisonment and death (67-68).

II. Act 3 (France)

a. (In prison) Toussaint encounters his jailers (74-75).
b. Toussaint resists the offers of the messenger of the consul (78-80).
c. Toussaint confronts his son, who has been educated in France and tries to convince his father to compromise with his captors (85-88). 
d. Toussaint is tortured and dies at the hands of his jailers (96-101). 

As the reader can see, when we bring these episodes together with those  of **Virtual Version A** and **B**, we have a coherent story. With the exception of the order of the segments in Act 1, we also have the general structure of the final version of the typescript. What additions come after **Virtual Version D** are mostly local. Césaire will reframe Act 2 several times, and the general tenor of the drama changes as the CRR plays an increasingly central role next to Toussaint, but the overall edifice remains the same.

The theme of temptation that will characterize all of the published versions of the drama is already dominant at this stage. The major difference between the typescript and the published versions is that temptation does not only present itself to Toussaint, but to the crowds as well. The steadfastness of Toussaint/Le Rebelle in the face of temptation contrasts with the crowd’s vulnerability, for whom Toussaint plays the role of Platonic educator. In this sense, the typescript explores the Promethean theme more thoroughly than the published versions by staging several encounters between Toussaint and the crowds. Later versions will rely more on the structure of *Prometheus Bound*, with Le Rebelle ‘bound’ in prison from beginning to end, making the promethean figure the center of our attention at the expense of the event.

Although **Virtual Version D** already evinces a shift in emphasis from the historical narrative proper to the heroic and poetic subject, the text preserves history as a referent. Critics have remarked, and this can be readily verified, that Césaire was not very rigorous in his citations. Because he is oftentimes inaccurate, especially in his reconstruction of the events in our text, we are left wondering whether the problem lay with his sources or whether he was actively engaging in myth making.

An effort is currently underway, most notably under the initiative of professor Jean Jonassaint of Syracuse University, to try to reconstruct Césaire’s readings on the Haitian Revolution based on clues found in his oeuvre. One of the most fascinating features of our typescript —especially the beginning segment of Act 2, which comes into play in **Virtual Version D**— is the presence of quotes (not always in quotation marks) from historical sources. These quotes are placed in the mouth of a series of random characters and—of course—no citation is given.

Here are two citations I have been able to identify:

> *2è orateur: Gloire à Toussaint Louverture, le Spartacus noir, le nègre prédit par Raynal pour venger les injures faites à sa race.* (42)

This line comes at the beginning of the episode, after the first orator has praised Toussaint for delivering the land from the tyrannical English. Ironically, the line from the second orator comes from the British evangelist Marcus Rainsford's *An historical account of the black empire of Hayti* (1805). Here are Rainsford’s words: "General Laveaux called him 'the negro, the Spartacus, foretold by Raynal, whose destiny it was to avenge the wrongs committed on his race'" (247).

The next exact match comes in quotes:

> Le grand Maitre de l'Université: Gloire et reconnaissance à Toussaint Louverture éducateur du peuple ! Libre à un Villaret-Joyeuse de fermer les écoles dans la Martinique voisine et de déclarer cyniquement : "L'ignorance est un lien nécessaire pour des hommes enchainés par la violence ou flétris par les préjugés".[^56] (43)

The quoted lines came originally from the *Capitaine-General* of Martinique and Saint-Lucie, Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, in a proposal to close down the schools under his jurisdiction. The original document was first published in 1861 in Augustin Cochin’s *L’Abolition de l’esclavage*. Other nineteenth-century books dealing with the question of slavery will reprint the lines, and I have not been able to determine whether Césaire copied it from Cochin or from later reprints of Villaret’s communiqué.[^57] The important point is that Césaire is using verbatim quotes from historical sources. This sort of ‘documentary’ approach was also one of the main innovations of Piscator for the theater, and reinforces some of the points we made earlier about Césaire’s use of avant-garde techniques. Although, as Attilio Favorini has demonstrated, the so-called documentary theater can be traced back to the Greeks, its modern incarnation in the work of Brecht and Piscator links it directly to questions of social justice, the role of crowds on stage, and other features more appropriate to Césaire’s drama.

Before moving from the typescript to the many other subsequent transformations of the text, we should briefly examine one last feature of **Virtual Version D**. As Table B shows, Act 3 is about half of what it would be when we reach pagination **Late A.** At this stage, it ends with Toussaint’s death and not with Dessalines continuation of the revolution, and it is missing a couple of recognizable episodes, especially the hallucinatory intrusion of “Le Grand Prohibiteur.” The setting and action of Act 3 will, for all intents and purposes, replace the historical settings in the published versions. At this early stage, the structure of the final act already echoes the overall structure of the text: Toussaint must ward-off the temptations coming from the enemy (the messenger), from his own people (his son), and from a divine being (the Holy Virgin). This simple structure of temptation will carry over in all other reincarnations of the drama. The echoes in both structure and theme will eventually make it easy for Césaire to bring all the action to the prison cell and leave the Haitian Revolution behind.

Toussaint Louverture and the Haitian Revolution were evoked as early as the 1939 version of the “Cahier d’un retour au pays natal”. Considering the importance of these two themes, their elision in the 1940’s should still give us pause. In 1960 Césaire will publish his biography of Toussaint, *La Révolution Française et le problème colonial*, which doubled as an analysis of the revolution, and which was an important contribution at the time. Soon thereafter, his first successful play, *La Tragedie du Roi Christophe*, resumes the story of the revolution where the narrative of the typescript ended. Though we have seen how Césaire began to distance his text from history, the possible why must wait for my next chapter.

Through systematic codicological and textual analysis, I have argued that the shift away from the events of the revolution and the transformation of Toussaint Louverture into an abstract Rebel began while the typescript was being drafted. The argument means to demonstrate the value of using rules-based virtual reconstructions for the study of complex modern manuscripts. In the next chapter, we will take a broader perspective on some of the themes explored in this chapter, in an attempt to answer the why and not the how of Césaire's move away from history. To accomplish our goal, we will address more familiar, and therefore less controversial textual unities (the book, the poem, the article, the preview, etc.) and their attendant geo-temporal complexities. In other words, we will move away from the decomposition and comparison of the one document with itself, to the comparison of many documents with each other.

Last week, regaling over some tequila mockingbirds with fellow traveler Dennis Tenen, the subject turned to the slippery two-way slope between the analog and the digital. In his forthcoming book, *Plain Text: The Poetics of Computation*, Tenen argues that the "properties that make media 'digital' or 'analog', reveal themselves to be neither universal nor essential to the medium. The medium is not the message."(30) What we find instead is a case-specific relay between the two in both computational and paper-based media at different scales, exemplified by the split of the sign across various surfaces (magnetic drives, carbon paper, cables, screen, etc.). The greatest trick the allograph ever pulled was to convince the world the ~60 Hertz flicker did not exist. Along those lines, it ocurred to me that no digital humanist we knew of had yet tried to data mine CSS files online to distant read the autographic surface of the screen. I was only half-joking.

[^21]: \[Go back inside, girls, playtime is over, the orbits of death push their fiery eyes through the pale mica\]

[^22]: \[Is it a riddle?\]

[^23]: This is the French equivalent of “Boo” in English. In other words, the girls are imitating the sounds of ghosts in mock-scary.

[^24]: We can't say with certainty how `P2` originally began because we are missing the first two pages.

[^25]: \[(At that moment darkness engulfs the stage; gunshots; discordant cries; gradually, the disturbance settles down; when the light returns, the décor has changed; the black camp in the middle of a forest. Meeting of black chiefs and white deputies.)\]

[^26]: \[(In the chasm of fright, a vast collective prison peopled with *nègres,* all contenders for madness and death; thirtieth day of the famine, the torture and the delirium.)\]

[^27]: On page `P1.15` we find, for example, a stage direction describing the smell of blood, and another, immediately after, describing the silence that falls on the stage as rigid and funereal. On the last page we find one of the most fascinating stage directions in the whole typescript and I discuss it directly later in the chapter. Page `P1.15` and the last page, `P1.20` (40), also share another peculiarity in addition to their extra-theatrical stage directions. They are the only two pages in `P1` without any dark pencil corrections. We should note also that half of the parentheses around stage directions in `P1` were added in pencil, especially on the first 6 pages, pages `P1.12` (32), `P1.17` (33) and `P1.18` (34). An argument can be made that these pages represent yet an earlier stage than the rest. Page `P1.15` and `P1.20` are, of course, probably the latest additions to `P1`.

[^28]: This refrain will play a pivotal role in the trajectory of the drama. As we will see in the next chapter, Césaire tones down his rhetorical stance when he publishes the text in an international context, and the refrain is mostly excised from the text. In 1956 Césaire will assign a couple of stanzas to the Rebel which question the wisdom of the rallying cry.

[^29]: Philippe François Rouxel, vicomte de Blanchelande, was governor of Saint-Domingue when the revolution began. The reference places the action around the end of 1791, right before Toussaint and other rebels met with the governor for fruitless negotiations. Unlike the Blanchelande of the drama, whose head ended up on a pike, the historical Blancheland returned safely to France in September of 1792, where in 1793 his head ended up in a basket.

[^30]: \[A sinister and buffoonish gathering, full of bombast and cruelty.\]

[^31]: In a later revision, Boukman gets crossed out in dark pencil, leaving Toussaint to build an army by himself.

[^32]: The historical Dutty Boukman was killed in November of 1791, and as far as I know, he did not fight alongside Toussaint. The ceremony of Bois Caïman, led by Boukman, took place on August 14, 1791. Toussaint is not documented at the ceremony that sparked the revolt cum revolution. What we do know is that he joined as doctor to the troops under the command of  Georges Biassou, a few weeks after the revolt had caught on. In December 1791, after Boukman's passing, he plays an important role in negotiations with the French Governor, marking the beginning of his historical rise to prominence. 

[^33]: Jean Jacques Dessalines was the most important leader of the revolution besides Toussaint Louverture.

[^34]: Ironically, the more ‘avant-garde’ version of 1946 will reclaim all three Aristotelian units of time, space and action.

[^35]: The song is mockingly reprised on page `P1.15` (35) by the vengeful crowds of slaves.

[^43]: Columbus also makes an important apparition in Jahn's adaptation. The echoes between Jahn's contributions in the 1950's and the early text, which Jahn never saw, continue to amaze me.

[^44]: \[In the back of the stage\]

[^45]: \[All of this appears mixed together on the screen\]

[^46]: \[The silence already poisons every fiber/Half-swallowed hieroglyphic gestures signal/The plowing and seeding of corpses\]

[^47]: \[The Reciter: A whistle… The blacks exit from the brushes with a great uproar. The cutlasses clash and they are raised again and they clash in the reel of exasperation.\]

[^48]: Note that this is not marked up on Table B, which in a sense conflates pagination schemes with order of composition. The reality is not so. While the pages were composed early, the `P2` pagination probably came much later. Considering the historical setting in this segment, they were also probably meant to follow `P1`.

[^49]: \[The Chorus: My eye is gilded with sovereign visions… Toussaint makes his solemn entry in Santo Domingo. The *cabildo* hands him the keys to the city.\] Césaire misspells the Spanish word *cabildo* (twice). A *cabildo* was a Spanish form of local government best understood as a colonial administrative council. It was indeed a Spanish *cabildo* in Hispaniola which surrendered to Toussaint Louverture in 1801.

[^50]: \[The scene is at Saint Domingue…at the time of the French Revolution\]

[^51]: \[The Chorus: Hurrah! The English have lost… Our batteries of approach sweep their ramparts… our breaching artillery is in place… Saint-Marc cracks… like a rotten ship.\]

[^52]: \[Toussaint: ~~I had brought~~ I will bring this country to the knowledge/ of itself,/ I ~~familiarized~~ will familiarize this land with its secret demons/~~lit~~ I will light the craters of helodermes and cymbals/the symphonies of an unknown hell, splendid/infested with haughty nostalgias.\]

[^53]: \[On the margins of jolting waves, I march on the water of turning Springs; I perceive high up my sentinel eyes. Foolproof, insomnia grows like the disobedience along the free temples of the woman with amphora, aquarius, aquarius germ tempest, kettle.\]

[^54]: The king in question could be a reference to Napoleon who by 1801 was already in power. The choice of king is not at all surprising since that word will become a grab-all for all forms of supreme rule in the drama. In the following scene in particular, it is precisely that title which is offered to Toussaint.

[^55]: \[Voices of temptation\]

[^56]: \[The grand University Professor: Glory and renown for Toussaint Louverture, educator of the masses! Leave it to Villaret-Joyeuse to close the schools in neighboring Martinique and cynically declare: “Ignorance is a necessary bond for men chained by violence or withered by prejudice.”\]
