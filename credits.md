Everyone I ever met. The people who made the internet and all the well wrought code I use. Forget Apple, I paid them well for this machine. Words. Columbia University for paying the bills. 

Special gratitude is reserved for those of you who will help me make this better by sharing your critiques and suggestions. When all of this is said and done, and with your blessing, I would like to list you on this page by name.
